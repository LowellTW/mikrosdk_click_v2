    "short_description": "IR Grid click is a thermal imaging sensor. It has an array of 64 very sensitive factory calibrated IR elements (pixels), arranged in 4 rows of 16 pixels, each measuring an object temperature up to 300˚C within its local Field of View (FOV). The MLX90621ESF-BAD IR sensor used on this Click board™ has only four pins, and it is mounted inside of the industry standard TO39 package. It is equipped with 2Kbit of EEPROM for storing the compensation and calibration parameters.",
