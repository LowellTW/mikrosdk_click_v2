    "short_description": "Accel 29 Click is a compact add-on board that contains an acceleration sensor. This board features the ADXL314, a three-axis Â±200g accelerometer from Analog Devices. The ADXL314 offers 16-bit digital output data with a configurable host interface that supports SPI and I2C serial communication. An integrated memory management system with a 32-level FIFO buffer can store data to minimize host processor activity and lower overall system power consumption. Low power modes enable intelligent motion-based power management with threshold sensing and active acceleration measurement at low power dissipation.",
