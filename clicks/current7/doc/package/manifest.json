    "short_description": "Current 7 Click is a compact add-on board providing a precise and accurate current sensing solution. This board features the INA282, a wide common-mode range, bidirectional, high-accuracy current shunt monitor from Texas Instruments. The INA282 represents a voltage output current shunt monitor that can sense drops across shunts at common-mode voltages from –14 V to +80 V, independent of the supply voltage, which operates in a range from 2.7V up to 18V supply. The zero-drift topology enables high-precision measurements with maximum input offset voltages as low as 70μV. Also, the user is allowed to process the output signal in analog or digital form.",
