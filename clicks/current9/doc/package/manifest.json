    "short_description": "Current 9 Click is a compact add-on board providing a precise and accurate current sensing solution. This board features the CT415-HSN830DR, high-bandwidth and ultra-low-noise XtremeSense® TMR current sensor designed for the current range up to 30A from Crocus Technology. This sensor also features an integrated current-carrying conductor which handles rated current and generates a current measurement as a linear analog output voltage, accomplishing a total output error of about ±1% full-scale. After that, the user is allowed to process the output voltage in analog or digital form.",
