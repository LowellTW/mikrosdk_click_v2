    "description": "8x8 Y click is a 64 LED matrix display Click boardâ„¢, composed of SMD LEDs organized in 8 rows by 8 columns. It has a digital brightness control in 16 steps, it can control every LED in the display matrix independently, it blanks the display on power up to eliminate glitches and it requires a single resistor to control the current through all the LEDs at once, which simplifies the design. 8x8 click uses a fast SPI communication protocol, allowing fast display response and no lag.",
