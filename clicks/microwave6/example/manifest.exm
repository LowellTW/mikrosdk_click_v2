    "description": "Microwave 6 Click is a compact add-on board that utilizes the Doppler Shift Phenomenon to sense motion. This board features the PD-V8-S, a high-frequency microwave sensor from Ningbo Pdlux Electronic Technology. The transmitter on this transceiver works on a 5.8GHz frequency over the patch antenna, with a 2-3kHz pulse repetition frequency. The strength of the sensorâ€™s output, in other words, the detection range, depends on the Signal-to-Noise ratio.",
