    "short_description": "Environment 4 Click is a compact add-on board combining 4th-generation SHT humidity and SGP air-quality sensing solutions from Sensirion. This board features SHT41A-AD1B and SGP41, an I2C-configurable high-accuracy relative humidity/temperature combined with a MOx-based gas sensor. The SHT41A-AD1B offers linearized digital output alongside temperature/humidity accuracy up to ±0.3°C/±2%RH. It performs best within the operating range of 5-60°C and 20-80%RH. With the help of SGP41, which features a temperature-controlled micro hotplate, it also provides a humidity-compensated VOC and NOx-based indoor air quality signal.",
