    "name": "Hall Current 12 Click",
    "description": "Hall Current 12 Click is a compact add-on board that provides economical and precise AC or DC current sensing solutions. This board features the TMCS1100, a galvanically isolated Hall-effect current sensor capable of DC or AC current measurement with high accuracy, excellent linearity, and temperature stability from Texas Instruments. It enables the lowest drift, <1% full-scale error, and highest accuracy over time and temperature. It also provides a reliable 600V lifetime working voltage and 3kVRMS isolation between the current path and circuitry with uni/bidirectional current sensing. Besides, the user is allowed to process the output signal in analog or digital form.",
