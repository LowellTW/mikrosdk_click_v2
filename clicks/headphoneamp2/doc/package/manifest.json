    "short_description": "Headphone AMP 2 Click is a compact add-on board that contains a headphone amplifier. This board features the TS2007FC, a class-D audio power amplifier from STMicroelectronics. The TS2007FC can drive up to 2.3W into 4Ω load at 5V, achieving better efficiency than typical class-AB audio power amplifiers. It can switch between two gain settings, either 6 or 12dB, through one mikroBUS™ pin, has the pop and click reduction circuitry, and a Standby mode for reduced power consumption. Besides, it is equipped with protection features, allowing a reliable operation.",
