    "description": "RF Meter 3 Click is a compact add-on board that collects information, analyzes RF power, and displays information in an easy-to-read digital format. This board features the LT5581, a low-power monolithic precision RMS power detector from Analog Devices. The RMS detector uses a proprietary technique to accurately measure the RF power in a range from 2GHz up to 2.6GHz, well-suited for signals with high crest factors. It outputs a DC voltage in linear scale proportional to an RF input signal power in dBm.",
