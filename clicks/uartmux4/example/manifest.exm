    "description": "UART MUX 4 Click is a compact add-on board that switches the UART pins (RX and TX) from the mikroBUSâ„¢ socket to one of the two available outputs. This board features the 74HC4066D, a quad single-pole, single-throw analog switch from Nexperia. The UART MUX 4 Click allows you to switch from one multiplexed UART to another easily, but not both simultaneously.",
