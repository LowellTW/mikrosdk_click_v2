    "short_description": "SolidSwitch 2 Click is a compact add-on board that contains a load switching device. This board features the L9026, an automotive eight-channel relay driver from STMicroelectronics. The L9026 incorporates two high-side drivers and six configurable high-side/low-side drivers driven by an SPI interface or by two dedicated parallel inputs. Operating from an external power supply from 3V up to 18V, it provides a maximum current of 1A on its output terminals. It also offers advanced diagnostic and protection features such as short-to-ground, open load, overcurrent, and overtemperature detections.",
