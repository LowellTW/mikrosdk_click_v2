    "short_description": "Barometer 10 Click is a compact add-on board that measures air pressure in a specific environment. This board features the LPS28DFW, an ultra-compact piezoresistive absolute pressure sensor that functions as a digital output barometer from STMicroelectronics. The LPS28DFW comprises a sensing element and an IC chip for signal processing in one package, converts pressure into a 24-bit digital value, and sends the information via I2C serial interface. It has a selectable dual full-scale absolute pressure range of up to 1260hPa and 4060hPa, with an absolute pressure accuracy of 0.5hPa over a wide operating temperature range.",
