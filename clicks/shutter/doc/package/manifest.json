    "short_description": "Shutter Click is an adapter Click board™ used to implement an automated capturing feature. This Click board™ features one 3.5mm jack connector suitable for a camera connection with which the frame is captured. By combining two mikroBUS™ pins and the VO617A, a high-reliability phototransistor from Vishay Semiconductors used as a camera activation switch, activating the camera's Auto-Focus and the action of taking pictures is realized. This Click board™ allows you to expressly capture frames in a simple way for various types of photographic and security applications to capture those parts you need.",
