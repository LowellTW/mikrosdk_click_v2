This board features the MCP2003B, a LIN transceiver from Microchip. The LIN, which stands for a Local Interconnect Network, is used in conjunction with the CAN interface for communication between the components inside of vehicles. The MCP2003B is a bi-directional half-duplex LIN transceiver that supports baud rates up to 20Kbaud with a LIN-compatible output driver. According to the standard on which this LIN transceiver works, connecting up to 15 peripheral devices to a single controller device is possible.",
