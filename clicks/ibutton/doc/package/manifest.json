    "short_description": "iButton click - is an iButton™ probe Click board™. The iButton is a Analog Devices technology based on Analog's 1-Wire® communication protocol, and a chip usually packed in a robust stainless steel casing. The button-shaped iButton device has two contacts - the lid and the base. These contacts carry the necessary connections down to a sensitive silicone chip, embedded inside the metal button. When the iButton touches the reader probe on the Click board™, it establishes the communication with the host MCU, via the 1-Wire® interface. The communication is almost instant, so it is enough to press the iButton lightly to the probe contacts.",
