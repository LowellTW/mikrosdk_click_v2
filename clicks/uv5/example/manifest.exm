    "description": "UV 5 Click is a compact add-on board that can measure UV radiation. This board features the AS7331, a spectral UVA/B/C sensor from ams. The sensor can measure UVA, UVB, and UVC, which are the main types of UV rays from the UV radiation of the sunlight. It uses ADC with a high dynamic range (16â€¦ 24-bit) for measurements from low to high radiation conditions and has a high sensitivity, which makes it usable for fluorescence light conditions.",
