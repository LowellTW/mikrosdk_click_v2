    "description": "3D Hall 4 Click is a compact add-on board that can detect the strength of a magnetic field in all three dimensions. This board features the SENM3Dx, a 3D Hall magnetic sensor from SENIS. It is a CMOS-integrated magnetic field sensor that allows the acquisition of all three magnetic field components at the same time and in the same spot. The sensor is equipped with on-chip EPROM to hold initialization, calibration data, and other settings and definitions.",
