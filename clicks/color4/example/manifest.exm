    "description": "Color 4 Click is a compact add-on board providing an accurate color-sensing solution. This board features the VEML6040, a 16-bit RGBW color sensor offering spectral response through a compatible I2C interface from Vishay Semiconductors. The VEML6040 is based on the Filtronâ„¢ technology achieving the closest ambient light spectral sensitivity to real-human eye responses. Alongside the color sensor, this IC also incorporates a signal conditioning circuit consisting of photodiodes, amplifiers, and A/D circuits placed into a single chip using the CMOS process. It provides a selectable measurement range up to 16.496lx with the highest sensitivity of 0.007865lx/step.",
