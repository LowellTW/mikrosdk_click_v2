    "description": "Light 2 Click is a compact add-on board designed for accurate and flexible light measurement in various environments. This board features the ISL76682, a high-sensitivity, light-to-digital sensor with an I2C interface from Renesas, made specifically for automotive applications. Key features include a photodiode array that closely mimics the human eye's response, an ADC for flicker rejection, and four selectable light measurement ranges via I2C, enhancing both flexibility and accuracy. With a typical power consumption of 55ÂµA in Standard mode and two power-down modes to minimize energy use, the board is efficient and adaptable to different lighting conditions.",
