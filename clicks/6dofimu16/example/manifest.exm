    "description": "6DOF IMU 16 Click is a compact add-on board with a 6-axis inertial measurement device. This board features the ICM-42605, a premium performance 6-axis MotionTrackingâ„¢ IMU from TDK InvenSense. It combines a 3-axis gyroscope and a 3-axis accelerometer, supporting the lowest gyroscope and accelerometer sensor noise in this IMU class. It also has the highest stability against temperature, shock, SMT/bend-induced offset, and more.",
