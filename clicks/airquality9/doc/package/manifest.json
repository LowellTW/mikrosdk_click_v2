    "short_description": "Air quality 9 Click is a compact add-on board containing a best-in-class air-quality sensing solution. This board features the ENS160, a digital multi-gas sensor solution based on metal oxide (MOX) technology with four MOx sensor elements from ScioSense. Each sensor element has independent hotplate control to detect a wide range of gases. The ENS160 series features TrueVOCâ„¢ air quality detection and supports intelligent algorithms, which calculate CO2 equivalents, TVOC, air quality index (AQI), and perform humidity and temperature compensation. This Click boardâ„¢ is interface-configurable and characterized by outstanding long-term stability and lifetime.",
