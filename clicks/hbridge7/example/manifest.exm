    "description": "H-Bridge 7 Click features flexible motor driver IC for a wide variety of applications, labeled as the DRV8876N. This Click boardâ„¢ integrates an N-channel H-bridge, charge pump regulator, and protection circuitry. The charge pump improves efficiency by allowing for both high-side and low-side N-channels MOSFETs and 100% duty cycle support. This IC allows the H-Bridge 7 Click to achieve ultra-low quiescent current draw by shutting down most of the internal circuitry with his low-power sleep mode.",
