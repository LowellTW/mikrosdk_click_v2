    "short_description": "LED Driver 15 Click is a compact add-on board that simplifies the control of multiple LEDs. This board features the MP3309C, a fully integrated synchronous boost white LED driver with an I2C interface from Monolithic Power Systems. The MP3309C offers high efficiency, delivers up to 40mA of LED current, and operates from a voltage of mikroBUSâ„¢ power rails, supporting up to 8 white LEDs in series. It also features a programmable switching frequency to optimize efficiency, supports analog and PWM dimming, and has multiple built-in protection functions that protect the circuit during abnormalities.",
