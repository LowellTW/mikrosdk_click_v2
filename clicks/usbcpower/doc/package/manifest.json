    "short_description": "USB-C Power Click is a compact add-on board that provides a quick and easy way to supply power without carrying multiple adapters or cables. This board features the TPS25750S, a highly integrated USB Type-C and Power Delivery (PD) controller with integrated power switches optimized for power applications from Texas Instruments. The TPS25750S integrates fully managed power paths (5V/3A with 36mÎ© sourcing switch) with robust protection (reverse and inrush current as well as over/under voltage protection) and control for external battery charger IC for a complete USB-C PD solution. Besides web-based GUI and pre-configured firmware, the TPS25750S also has some GPIOs and LED indicators that are user-defined for either status or control information.",
