# Button Y Click

Button Y Click is a Click boardâ„¢ equipped with the tactile switch, sometimes referred to as a pushbutton. A pushbutton is a component that is used very often in various designs, allowing the user to interact with the application. Although it sounds simple, a button needs to comply with a range of application requirements. It needs to have a very good mechanical endurance while retaining its specifications, a predictable bouncing time, a very low ON resistance, very high OFF resistance, and it needs to fulfill aesthetical requirements.

#### Click library

- **Author**        : Nikola Peric
- **Date**          : Feb 2022.
- **Type**          : PWM type


# Software Support

We provide a library for the ButtonY Click
as well as a demo application (example), developed using MikroElektronika
[compilers](https://www.mikroe.com/necto-studio).
The demo can run on all the main MikroElektronika [development boards](https://www.mikroe.com/development-boards).

Package can be downloaded/installed directly from *NECTO Studio Package Manager*(recommended way), downloaded from our [LibStock&trade;](https://libstock.mikroe.com) or found on [Mikroe github account](https://github.com/MikroElektronika/mikrosdk_click_v2/tree/master/clicks).

## Library Description

> This library contains API for ButtonY Click driver.

#### Standard key functions :

- `buttony_cfg_setup` Config Object Initialization function.
```c
void buttony_cfg_setup ( buttony_cfg_t *cfg );
```

- `buttony_init` Initialization function.
```c
err_t buttony_init ( buttony_t *ctx, buttony_cfg_t *cfg );
```

#### Example key functions :

- `buttony_pwm_stop` This function stops the PWM moudle output.
```c
err_t buttony_pwm_stop ( buttony_t *ctx );
```

- `buttony_pwm_start` This function starts the PWM moudle output.
```c
err_t buttony_pwm_start ( buttony_t *ctx );
```

- `buttony_get_button_state` This function reads the digital signal from the INT pin which tells us whether the button has been pressed or not.
```c
uint8_t buttony_get_button_state ( buttony_t *ctx );
```

## Example Description

>  This library contains API for Button Y Click driver. 
>  One library is used for every single one of them.
>  They are simple touch detectors that send a pressed/released 
>  signal and receive a PWM output which controls the backlight on the button.

**The demo application is composed of two sections :**

### Application Init

> This function initializes and configures the logger and Click modules.

```c

void application_init ( void )  
{
    log_cfg_t log_cfg;          /**< Logger config object. */
    buttony_cfg_t buttony_cfg;  /**< Click config object. */

    /** 
     * Logger initialization.
     * Default baud rate: 115200
     * Default log level: LOG_LEVEL_DEBUG
     * @note If USB_UART_RX and USB_UART_TX 
     * are defined as HAL_PIN_NC, you will 
     * need to define them manually for log to work. 
     * See @b LOG_MAP_USB_UART macro definition for detailed explanation.
     */
    LOG_MAP_USB_UART( log_cfg );
    log_init( &logger, &log_cfg );
    log_info( &logger, " Application Init " );

    // Click initialization.

    buttony_cfg_setup( &buttony_cfg );
    BUTTONY_MAP_MIKROBUS( buttony_cfg, MIKROBUS_1 );
    err_t init_flag  = buttony_init( &buttony, &buttony_cfg );
    if ( PWM_ERROR == init_flag ) 
    {
        log_error( &logger, " Application Init Error. " );
        log_info( &logger, " Please, run program again... " );

        for ( ; ; );
    }
    Delay_ms ( 500 );
    
    buttony_set_duty_cycle ( &buttony, 0.0 );
    buttony_pwm_start( &buttony );
    
    log_info( &logger, " Application Task " );
}

```

### Application Task

>  This example first increases the backlight on the button and then decreases the intensity of 
>  backlight. When the button is pressed,
>  reports the event in the console using UART communication.

```c

void application_task ( void ) 
{
    static float duty_cycle;
    static uint8_t button_state;
    static uint8_t button_state_old;

    button_state = buttony_get_button_state( &buttony );
    
    if ( button_state && ( button_state != button_state_old ) ) 
    {
        log_printf( &logger, " <-- Button pressed --> \r\n" );
        for ( uint8_t n_cnt = 1; n_cnt <= 100; n_cnt++  )
        {
            duty_cycle = ( float ) n_cnt ;
            duty_cycle /= 100;
            buttony_set_duty_cycle( &buttony, duty_cycle );
            Delay_ms ( 10 );
        }
        button_state_old = button_state;
    } 
    else if ( !button_state && ( button_state != button_state_old ) ) 
    {
        for ( uint8_t n_cnt = 100; n_cnt > 0; n_cnt-- )
        {
            duty_cycle = ( float ) n_cnt ;
            duty_cycle /= 100;
            buttony_set_duty_cycle( &buttony,  duty_cycle );
            Delay_ms ( 10 );
        }
        button_state_old = button_state;
    }
}

```

The full application code, and ready to use projects can be installed directly from *NECTO Studio Package Manager*(recommended way), downloaded from our [LibStock&trade;](https://libstock.mikroe.com) or found on [Mikroe github account](https://github.com/MikroElektronika/mikrosdk_click_v2/tree/master/clicks).

**Other Mikroe Libraries used in the example:**

- MikroSDK.Board
- MikroSDK.Log
- Click.ButtonY

**Additional notes and informations**

Depending on the development board you are using, you may need
[USB UART Click](https://www.mikroe.com/usb-uart-click),
[USB UART 2 Click](https://www.mikroe.com/usb-uart-2-click) or
[RS232 Click](https://www.mikroe.com/rs232-click) to connect to your PC, for
development systems with no UART to USB interface available on the board. UART
terminal is available in all MikroElektronika
[compilers](https://shop.mikroe.com/compilers).
