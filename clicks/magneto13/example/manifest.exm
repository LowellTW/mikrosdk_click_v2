    "description": "Magneto 13 Click is a compact add-on board with an accurate and reliable magnetic device. This board features the MA736, a contactless digital angle sensor from Monolithic Power Systems. It is a MagAlpha sensor that detects the absolute angular position of a permanent magnet, typically a diametrically magnetized cylinder or a rotating shaft. The MA736 sensor supports a wide range of magnetic field strengths, end-of-shaft, and side-shaft (off-axis mounting) spatial configurations.",
