    "description": "Air Velocity Click is a compact add-on board that measures direct airspeed. This board features the FS3000-1005, a surface-mount type air velocity module utilizing a MEMS thermopile-based sensor from Renesas. This I2C-configurable air velocity module features a digital output with a 12-bit resolution with a wide operational range of 0-7.2meter/second (0-16.2mph). The sensor comprises a “solid” thermal isolation technology and silicon-carbide coating to protect it from abrasive wear and water condensation.",
