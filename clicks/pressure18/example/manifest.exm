    "description": "Pressure 18 Click is a compact add-on board that contains a board-mount pressure sensor. This board features the BMP384, a robust barometric pressure sensor delivering market-leading accuracy in a compact package from Bosch Sensortec. The BMP384 provides a relative accuracy of Â±9Pa and typical absolute accuracy of Â±50Pa with ultra-low noise, low power consumption, and a temperature coefficient offset of Â±1Pa/K. It converts output data into a 24-bit digital value and sends the information via a configurable host interface that supports SPI and I2C serial communications. It measures pressure from 300hPa to 1250hPa over a wide operating temperature range.",
