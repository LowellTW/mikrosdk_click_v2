    "description": "Barometer 8 Click is a compact add-on board used to measure air pressure in a specific environment. This board features the ILPS22QS, an ultra-compact piezoresistive absolute pressure sensor that functions as a digital output barometer from STMicroelectronics. The ILPS22QS comprises a sensing element and an IC chip for signal processing in one package, converts pressure into a 24-bit digital value, and sends the information via a configurable host interface that supports SPI and I2C serial communications. It has a selectable dual full-scale absolute pressure range, up to 1260hPa and 4060hPa, with an accuracy of 0.5hPa over a wide operating temperature range.",
