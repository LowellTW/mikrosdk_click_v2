    "description": "DC Motor 23 Click is a compact add-on board with a brushed DC motor driver. This board features the TB67H480FNG, a dual-channel, H-bridge, brushed DC motor driver from Toshiba Semiconductor. Fabricated with the BiCD process (DMOSFET is used for output power transistor), it covers a wide operating voltage range of 8.2V to 44V with a maximum output current capacity of 2A. It also offers many helpful features that support a robust and reliable operation, like the decay modes selection function, several protection features, and one anomaly detection indicator.",
