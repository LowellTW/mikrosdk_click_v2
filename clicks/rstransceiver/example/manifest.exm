    "description": "RS Transceiver is a compact add-on board that offers an interface between the TTL level UART and RS-232/RS-422/RS-485 communication buses. This board features the XR34350, an RS-232/RS-422/RS-485 serial transceiver with internal termination and wide output swing from MaxLinear. Integrated cable termination and four configuration modes allow all three protocols to be used interchangeably over a single cable over the DE-9 connector. All transmitter outputs and receiver inputs feature robust ESD protection and HBM up to Â±15kV.",
