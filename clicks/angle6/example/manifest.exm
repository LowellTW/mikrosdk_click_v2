    "name": "Angle 6 Click",
    "description": "Angle 6 Click is a compact add-on board that detects the absolute angular position of a permanent magnet, typically a diametrically magnetized cylinder on a rotating shaft. This board features the MAQ470GQE, a 12-bit contactless angle sensor with PWM output from Monolithic Power Systems. It supports a wide range of magnetic field strengths and spatial configurations, with both end-of-shaft and off-axis (side-shaft mounting), supported configurations. Fast data acquisition and processing provides accurate angle measurement at speeds from 0 to 60,000 rpm, alongside magnetic field strength detection with programmable thresholds.",
