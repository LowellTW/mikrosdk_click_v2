    "short_description": "IoT ExpressLink 2 Click is a compact add-on board that allows users to connect to IoT ExpressLink services easily and securely interact with cloud applications and other services. This board features the SARA-R510AWS, an LTE-M AWS IoT EsxpressLink module from u-blox. It supports a comprehensive set of 3GPP Rel. 14 features that are relevant for IoT applications, like improvements to power consumption, coverage, data rate, mobility, and positioning. They are 5G-ready, meaning customers will be able to (software) upgrade their deployed devices once 5G LTE has been fully rolled out by mobile operators, greatly improving end-product scalability and lifetime.",
