    "short_description": "GNSS MAX 2 Click is a compact add-on board designed for precise positioning in urban environments. This board features the MAX-F10S, a professional-grade L1/L5 dual-band GNSS receiver from u-blox. This receiver uses dual-band GNSS technology to provide meter-level accuracy, even in challenging urban areas, by mitigating multipath effects. It supports concurrent GPS, Galileo, and BeiDou constellation tracking, offering robust performance with integrated filters and a low-noise amplifier for protection against RF interference. GNSS MAX 2 Click is ideal for vehicle tracking, fleet management, and micromobility solutions, even with small antennas.",
