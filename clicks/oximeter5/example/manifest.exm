    "description": "Oximeter 5 Click is a compact add-on board suitable for measuring blood oxygen saturation. This board features the MAX30102, integrated pulse oximetry, and heart-rate monitor module from Analog Devices. The MAX30102 includes internal LEDs, photodetectors, optical elements, and low-noise electronics with ambient light rejection. It operates on a single 1.8V power supply acquired from both mikroBUSâ„¢ power rails for the internal LEDs, communicating through a standard I2C compatible interface. The MAX30102 can be shut down through software with zero standby current, allowing the power rails to remain powered at all times.",
