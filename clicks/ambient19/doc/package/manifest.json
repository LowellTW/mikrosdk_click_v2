    "short_description": "Ambient 19 Click is a compact add-on board used to measure the amount of the present ambient light. This board features the APM-16D24-310-DF8/TR8, a digital output ambient light and proximity sensor with an I2C interface and interrupt from Everlight Electronics. It has a flexible and wide operating range for the ambient light sensor with a maximum resolution of 0.0023Lux/count and full detectable illumination of 57880Lux. The proximity function has an adjustable number of IR pulses from 1 to 256, and a flexible IR LED driving current to meet different application requirements. It is also equipped with an integrated filter to reduce unwanted IR signals and noise from the environment.",
