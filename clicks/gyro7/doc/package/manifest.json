    "short_description": "Gyro 7 Click is a compact add-on board that contains a high-performance gyroscope. This board features the ICG-1020S, a dual-axis MEMS angular rate sensor (gyroscope) from TDK InvenSense. The ICG-1020S provides extremely low RMS noise as well as noise density. The high-resolution gyroscope supports a full-scale programmable range of Â±46.5dps to Â±374dps, a fast sample rate at up to 32kHz, an SPI serial interface, and extremely low power consumption. This Click boardâ„¢ is designed for optical image stabilization (OIS) applications.",
