    "description": "Stepper 23 Click is a compact add-on board designed to drive small stepping motors in consumer electronics and industrial equipment applications. This board features the TB67S569FTG, a BiCD constant-current 2-phase bipolar stepping motor driver IC from Toshiba Semiconductor. Key features include a PWM chopper-type 2-phase bipolar drive system, high withstand voltage of up to 34V operating, and a maximum operating current of 1.8A per phase. The board also integrates safety mechanisms such as over-temperature, over-current, and low-supply voltage detection. Additional control is provided by the PCA9555A port expander via I2C, enabling functions like decay and torque modes, step resolution settings, and many more.",
