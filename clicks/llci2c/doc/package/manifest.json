    "short_description": "LLC I2C click can be utilized as the level converter for logic signals, which makes it a very useful Click boardâ„¢. The topology of this logic level conversion (LLC) circuit is perfectly suited for the bi-directional I2C communication. Although there are some specialized integrated circuits on the market, sometimes it is more convenient to have a simple solution made of just a few passive elements and four MOSFETs.",
