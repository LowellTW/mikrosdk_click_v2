This board features the TPL0102, a dual-channel digital potentiometer with non-volatile memory from Texas Instruments. It is a 100K resistance end-to-end potentiometer with a 256-position resolution, where the wiper position can be stored in EEPROM. It can operate from both 3.3V and 5V power supplies and provides a typical 92ppm/ºC end-to-end nominal resistance temperature coefficient and only 4ppm/ºC ratiometric.",
