    "short_description": "Magneto 11 Click is a compact add-on board that contains an accurate and reliable magnetic sensing device. This board features the AS5510, a linear hall sensor with 10-bit resolution, and an I2C interface from ams AG. It can measure the absolute position of lateral movement of a simple 2-pole magnet. A lateral stroke of 0.5mm ~ 2mm can be measured with air gaps around 1.0mm, depending on the magnet size. The AS5510 may be switched to a Power-Down state when it is not used to conserve power. This Click boardâ„¢ is suitable for position sensing applications requiring a small magnetic range where noise is a critical design parameter.",
