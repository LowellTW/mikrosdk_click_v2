    "description": "GNSS RTK Click is a compact add-on board used to enhance the precision of position data derived from satellite-based positioning systems. This board features the ZED-F9P, a multi-band GNSS module with integrated multi-band Real Time Kinematics (RTK) technology offering centimeter-level accuracy from U-blox. This module concurrently uses GNSS signals from all four GNSS constellations (GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, and BeiDou), and provides multi-band RTK with fast convergence times, reliable performance, and easy integration. It also includes moving base support, allowing both base and rover to move while computing a centimeter-level accurate position between them.",
