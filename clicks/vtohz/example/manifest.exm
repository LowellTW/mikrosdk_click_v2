    "name": "V to Hz Click",
    "description": "V to HZ click is a device that converts an analog voltage input signal into a pulse wave signal of a certain frequency. It has a linear response, so applying a voltage in a range of 0 to 5V on its input, will result in generating the pulse train with frequency linearly proportional to the input voltage.",
