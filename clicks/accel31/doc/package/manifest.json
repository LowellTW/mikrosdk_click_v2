    "short_description": "Accel 31 Click is a compact add-on board designed for precise motion and orientation detection in space-constrained devices. This board features the BMA580, a triaxial low-g accelerometer from Bosch Sensortec, which offers a 16-bit digital resolution with measurement ranges of ±2, ±4, ±8, and ±16 g, along with flexible output data rates from 1.56Hz to 6.4kHz, enabling high adaptability and accuracy. The BMA580 supports advanced power modes, including high-performance and low-power, self-wake-up functionality, and bone conduction-based voice activity detection.",
