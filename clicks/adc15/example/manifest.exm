    "description": "ADC 15 Click is a compact add-on board that contains a high-performance data converter. This board features the ADS131M02, a two-channel, simultaneously sampling, 24-bit, delta-sigma (ΔΣ), analog-to-digital converter from Texas Instruments. The ADC inputs can be independently configured via serial peripheral interface depending on the sensor input. A low noise, programmable gain amplifier (PGA) provides gains ranging from 1 to 128 to amplify low-level signals.",
