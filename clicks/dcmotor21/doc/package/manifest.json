    "short_description": "DC Motor 21 Click is a compact add-on board that contains a brushed DC motor driver. This board features the A3910, a DC motor driver designed for low voltage power applications from Allegro Microsystems. It is controlled via several GPIO pins and has a wide operating voltage range with an output current capacity of 500mA. In addition to the possibility to be used in the full-bridge configuration to drive a single bidirectional DC motor, it can also be used as a dual half-bridge to drive dual DC motors.",
