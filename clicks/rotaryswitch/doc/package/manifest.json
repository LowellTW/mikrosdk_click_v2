    "short_description": "Rotary Switch Click is a compact add-on board for applications requiring precise rotary input. This board is based on the RDS6-16S-1065-1-SMT, a 16-position notched cap surface-mount rotary DIP switch from Same Sky. This switch features continuous 360-degree actuator rotation, a 2.54mm pin pitch, and robust construction with a contact resistance of 80mÎ© and a maximum operating torque of 700gf*cm, ensuring reliable operation for up to 10,000 steps. The board supports the innovative Click Snap feature, allowing the rotary switch to operate autonomously when detached, providing flexibility in various implementations.",
