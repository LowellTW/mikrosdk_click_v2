    "description": "Tamper click is equipped with SDS001, a low profile side-actuated detect switch, made by C&K company. This is a high-quality, low-current detection switch, which is designed in a form of a push button. The switch itself is very small - only 2mm of switch overtravel length, which coupled with its low actuation force, makes it ideal for using it as a contact detector in various applications - consumer electronics devices, medical devices, smart card detection and similar applications.",
