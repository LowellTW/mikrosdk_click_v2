    "description": "<Terminal click can be extremely interesting for the development of systems that are equipped with mikroBUSâ„¢ slots only, or a small number of GPIO pins available, such as the Clicker family of development systems. Using this click on such a system will greatly improve its usability, and yet it will remain small, compact and manageable.>",
