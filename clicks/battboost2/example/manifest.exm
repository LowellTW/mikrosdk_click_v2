    "name": "BATT Boost 2 Click",
    "description": "BATT Boost 2 Click is a compact add-on board designed to extend the battery life of non-rechargeable, primary batteries in low-voltage, low-power applications. This board features the NBM7100A, a coin-cell battery-life booster with adaptive power optimization from Nexperia. The NBM7100A integrates two high-efficiency DC-DC conversion stages and an intelligent learning algorithm to optimize energy usage, allowing it to handle bursts of current up to 200mA without depleting the battery. It features two output terminals: VDH for high pulse load applications and VDP for powering 'Always-ON' components. Communication with the host MCU is achieved via the I2C interface, supporting up to 1MHz clock frequencies.",
