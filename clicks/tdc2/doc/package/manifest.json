    "short_description": "TDC 2 Click is a compact add-on board that recognizes events and provides a digital representation of the time they occurred. This board features ScioSenseâ€™s AS6500, a four-channel time-to-digital converter (TDC) frontend with high measurement performance and high data throughput. The AS6500 is characterized by simple data post-processing thanks to calibrated results (calculates calibrated stop measurements referenced to the applied reference clock).",
