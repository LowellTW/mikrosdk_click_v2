    "description": "Zero-Cross Click is a compact add-on board that has the ability to detect the change from positive to negative or negative to a positive level of a sinusoidal waveform. This board features circuitry that provides Zero Crossing Detection (ZCD). Whenever the sine wave crosses the ground potential, the output shifts from HIGH logic to LOW or vice-versa. ",
