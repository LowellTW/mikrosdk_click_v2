    "short_description": "Stepper 22 Click is a compact add-on board designed for precise motion control of bipolar stepper motors and brushed DC motors. This board features the DRV8711, a bipolar stepper motor gate driver from Texas Instruments, which uses external N-channel MOSFETs to drive motors with up to 5A of output current. The board features a wide range of microstepping options from full-step to 1/256-step, adaptive blanking time, and various current decay modes, ensuring smooth and accurate motor operation. Control is achieved via a standard SPI interface and STEP/DIR inputs, with additional management through an onboard I2C-configurable GPIO expander.",
