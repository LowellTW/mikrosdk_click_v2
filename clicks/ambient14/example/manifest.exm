    "description": "Ambient 14 Click is a compact add-on board for ambient light and proximity detection applications. This board features the TMD2755, an advanced sensor from ams OSRAM, which combines ambient light sensing (ALS) and proximity detection in a single, compact module. The TMD2755 features an integrated infrared VCSEL and driver and a proximity engine that includes offset adjustment and ambient light subtraction for enhanced accuracy. It provides 16-bit data output for ALS and proximity detection, allowing precise control of backlight brightness in devices.",
