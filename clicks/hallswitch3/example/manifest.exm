    "description": "Hall Switch 3 Click is a compact add-on board representing a magnetic field-activated switch. This board features the NMH1000, a Hall-effect magnetic switch from NXP Semiconductor. It is a low-voltage, low-current, and low-output data rate device with a very small size. The switch is most sensitive to a vertical field passing through the top-bottom surfaces, orthogonal to the plane of the Hall Switch 3 Click boardâ„¢.",
