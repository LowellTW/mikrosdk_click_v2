# Adapter click

Adapter click™ is a breakout board which simplifies connection of add-on boards with IDC10 headers to mikroBUS™ socket. There are two ways of establishing connection: using male or female IDC10 connectors.

#### Click library 

- **Author**        : MikroE Team
- **Date**          : maj 2020.
- **Type**          : I2C/SPI type


# Software Support

We provide a library for the Adapter Click 
as well as a demo application (example), developed using MikroElektronika 
[compilers](https://shop.mikroe.com/compilers). 
The demo can run on all the main MikroElektronika [development boards](https://shop.mikroe.com/development-boards).

Package can be downloaded/installed directly form compilers IDE(recommended way), or downloaded from our LibStock, or found on mikroE github account. 

## Library Description

> This library contains API for Adapter Click driver.

#### Standard key functions :

- Config Object Initialization function.
> void adapter_cfg_setup ( adapter_cfg_t *cfg ); 
 
- Initialization function.
> ADAPTER_RETVAL adapter_init ( adapter_t *ctx, adapter_cfg_t *cfg );


#### Example key functions :

- This function writes data to the desired register.
> void adapter_generic_write ( adapter_t *ctx, uint8_t reg, uint8_t *data_buf, uint8_t len );
 
- This function reads data from the desired register.
> void adapter_generic_read ( adapter_t *ctx, uint8_t reg, uint8_t *data_buf, uint8_t len );


## Examples Description

> Adapter click is a breakout board which simplifies connection of add-on boards. 
> There are two ways of establishing connection: using male or female IDC10 connectors. 
> Male header must be soldered on the top side of Adapter Click to connect the add-on board 
> directly or via flat cable. Female header can be soldered either on the top, or the bottom 
> side, depending on which one is more convenient in given circumstances.  
> There are two jumpers for SPI/I2C selection and one for selection of power supply range.

**The demo application is composed of two sections :**

### Application Init 

> Initalizes I2C or SPI driver and makes an initial log. 

```c

void application_init ( void )
{
    log_cfg_t log_cfg;
    adapter_cfg_t cfg;

    /** 
     * Logger initialization.
     * Default baud rate: 115200
     * Default log level: LOG_LEVEL_DEBUG
     * @note If USB_UART_RX and USB_UART_TX 
     * are defined as HAL_PIN_NC, you will 
     * need to define them manually for log to work. 
     * See @b LOG_MAP_USB_UART macro definition for detailed explanation.
     */
    LOG_MAP_USB_UART( log_cfg );
    log_init( &logger, &log_cfg );
    log_info( &logger, "---- Application Init ----" );

    //  Click initialization.

    adapter_cfg_setup( &cfg );
    ADAPTER_MAP_MIKROBUS( cfg, MIKROBUS_1 );
    adapter_init( &adapter, &cfg );
}
  
```

### Application Task

> This is an example that shows the use of the Adapter click board (SPI mode -  set as default). 
> In I2C mode we are reading internal temperature from another device (THERMO 5 click board).
> In SPI mode example we are writing "mikroElektronika" on SRAM click board, 
> and than reading from the same memory location.

```c

void application_task ( void )
{
    float temp_value;

    if ( adapter.master_sel == ADAPTER_MASTER_SPI )
    {
        log_printf( &logger, " Writing text :\r\n" );
   
        for ( n_cnt = 0; n_cnt < 16; n_cnt++ )
        {
            sram_write_byte( &adapter, n_cnt, send_buffer[ n_cnt ] );
            Delay_ms ( 100 );
            log_printf( &logger, "%c", send_buffer[ n_cnt ] );
        }
    
    
        log_printf( &logger, "\r\n" );
        log_printf( &logger, " Read text :\r\n" );
        for ( n_cnt = 0; n_cnt < 16; n_cnt++ )
        {
            mem_data[ n_cnt ] = sram_read_byte( &adapter, n_cnt );
            Delay_ms ( 100 );
            log_printf( &logger, "%c", mem_data[ n_cnt ] );
        }   
        log_printf( &logger, "\r\n" );
        log_printf( &logger, "--------------------------\r\n" );
    
        Delay_ms ( 1000 );
    }
    else if ( adapter.master_sel == ADAPTER_MASTER_I2C )
    {
        temp_value = thermo5_read_inter_temp( &adapter );

        log_printf( &logger, " Thermo 5 internal temperature :  %.2f\r\n", temp_value );
        log_printf( &logger, "--------------------------\r\n" );
    
        Delay_ms ( 1000 );
        Delay_ms ( 1000 );
    }
}

```


The full application code, and ready to use projects can be  installed directly form compilers IDE(recommneded) or found on LibStock page or mikroE GitHub accaunt.

**Other mikroE Libraries used in the example:** 

- MikroSDK.Board
- MikroSDK.Log
- Click.Adapter

**Additional notes and informations**

Depending on the development board you are using, you may need 
[USB UART click](https://shop.mikroe.com/usb-uart-click), 
[USB UART 2 Click](https://shop.mikroe.com/usb-uart-2-click) or 
[RS232 Click](https://shop.mikroe.com/rs232-click) to connect to your PC, for 
development systems with no UART to USB interface available on the board. The 
terminal available in all Mikroelektronika 
[compilers](https://shop.mikroe.com/compilers), or any other terminal application 
of your choice, can be used to read the message.
