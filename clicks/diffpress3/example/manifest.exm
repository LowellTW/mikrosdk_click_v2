    "description": "Diff Press 3 Click is a compact add-on board that can measure differential pressure. It features the 2513130810401, a WSEN-PDUS differential pressure sensor from WÃ¼rth Elektronik. The sensor is MEMS based and uses a piezo-resistive sensing principle. It is a fully calibrated pressure sensor with 15-bit digital and 11-bit analog outputs. In addition to pressure measurement, the 2513130810401 WSEN-PDUS sensor also has an embedded temperature sensor.",
