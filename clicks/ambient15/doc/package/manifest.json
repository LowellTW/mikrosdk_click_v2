    "short_description": "Ambient 15 Click is a compact add-on board used to measure the amount of the present ambient light. This board features the TSL2584TSV, a very-high sensitivity light-to-digital converter with an I2C interface that transforms light intensity into a digital output signal from AMS-AG. The TSL2584TSVâ€™s near-photopic response produces a highly accurate lux measurement up to 33klx even when mounted behind dark glass. Filtering out unwanted IR light enables the sensor to measure the ambient light more accurately, thus producing a near-photopic response.",
