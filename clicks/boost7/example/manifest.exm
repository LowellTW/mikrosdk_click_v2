    "description": "Boost 7 Click is a compact add-on board that steps up the voltage from its input (supply) to its output (load). This board features the BD8316GWL, a dual DC/DC converter from Rohm Semiconductor. Each converter inside the BD8316GWL is designed with up to 200mA current limit generating well-regulated positive and negative outputs of ±3.3V or ±5V, making the BD8316GWL ideal for various applications. In addition to the possibility of working with both mikroBUS™ power rails, it also provides the opportunity of using an external power supply with a very low voltage of 2.5V.",
