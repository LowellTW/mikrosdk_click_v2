    "name": "DC Motor 8 Click",
    "description": "DC Motor 8 click is a DC motor driver. It can drive simple DC motors with brushes, providing them with a significant amount of current and voltage up to 40V. The click has one control input, that uses the PWM signal from the host MCU. It uses the half-bridge topology to regulate the speed of the motor rotation, employs advanced dead-time circuitry that monitors the output stage, providing maximum switching efficiency and features an advanced technique to avoid shoot-through currents.",
