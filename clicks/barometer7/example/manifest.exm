    "description": "Barometer 7 Click is a compact add-on board used to measure air pressure in a specific environment. This board features the KP264XTMA1, a high-accuracy digital barometric air pressure sensor based on a capacitive principle from Infineon Technologies. The KP264XTMA1 is surface micromachined with a monolithic integrated signal conditioning circuit implemented in BiCMOS technology that converts pressure into a 10-bit digital value and sends the information via the SPI interface. It measures pressure from 40kPa up to 115kPa with an accuracy of Â±1.5kPa over a wide operating temperature range.",
