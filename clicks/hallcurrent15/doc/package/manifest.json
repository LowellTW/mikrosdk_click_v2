    "short_description": "Hall Current 15 Click is a compact add-on board that provides precise AC or DC current-sensing solution. This board features the TMCS1101-Q1, a galvanically isolated Hall-effect current sensor capable of DC or AC current measurement with high accuracy, excellent linearity, and temperature stability from Texas Instruments. A low-drift, temperature-compensated signal chain provides <1.5% full-scale error across a broad operating temperature range. It also provides a reliable 600V lifetime working voltage and 3kVRMS isolation between the current path and circuitry with uni/bidirectional current sensing. Besides, the user is allowed to process the output signal in analog or digital form.",
