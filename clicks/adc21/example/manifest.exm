    "description": "ADC 21 Click is a compact add-on board that converts an analog voltage into a digital representation. This board features the ADC1283, a low-power, eight-channel pure CMOS 12-bit analog-to-digital converter from STMicroelectronics. The ADC1283 is specified for conversion from 50ksps to 200ksps. Its architecture is based on a successive approximation register with an internal track-and-hold cell. It features eight single-ended multiplexed inputs, where the output serial data is straight binary and SPI-compatible.",
