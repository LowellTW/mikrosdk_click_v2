    "name": "Stepper 4 Click",
    "description": "Stepper 4 click is a very versatile bipolar stepping motor driver. It features TB67S269FTG IC, fabricated with the BiCD process, allowing the Click boardâ„¢ to handle significant voltage and current levels up to 35V and 1.2A. This IC has the integrated translator section, used to simplify the control: using simple step control inputs from the host MCU, the stepper motor can be driven in both directions, with the predetermined step sizes from the full step, up to 1/32 step.",
