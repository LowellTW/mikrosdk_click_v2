    "description": "Angle 9 Click is a compact add-on board that detects the absolute position of a permanent magnet. This board features the AAS33001, a precision angle sensor with incremental and motor commutation outputs and on-chip linearization from Allegro Microsystems. It is a contactless angle sensor for 0° to 360° angular position, rotation speed, and directional measurement. Support for incremental output interface (ABI) and motor commutation (UVW) is also available. The same goes for the on-chip EEPROM for storing factory and customer calibration parameters.",
