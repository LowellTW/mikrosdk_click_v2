    "description": "LightHz Click is a compact add-on board that effectively measures ambient light intensity. This board features the TL2L30BR, a programmable light-to-frequency converter from ams. The sensor outputs either a pulse train or a square wave (50% duty cycle) with a frequency directly proportional to light intensity (irradiance). It has programmable sensitivity and full-scale output frequency and could be used as a rough color detector with a selectable frequency range.",
