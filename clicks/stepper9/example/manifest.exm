    "description": "Stepper 9 Click is a compact add-on board that contains a bipolar stepper motor driver. This board features the TB67S581FNG, a two-phase bipolar stepping motor driver from Toshiba Semiconductor. Fabricated with the BiCD process, it supports a PWM constant-current control drive and steps resolution from full to 1/32 for less motor noise and smoother control. It has a wide operating voltage range of 8.2V to 44V with a maximum output current capacity of 2A, decay modes selection function, protection, and several anomaly detection indicators.",
