    "description": "Piezo Accel 2 Click - 50g is a compact add-on board for precise vibration and motion monitoring in condition-based maintenance applications. This board features the 830M1-0050, a triaxial piezoelectric accelerometer from TE Connectivity, capable of detecting motion and acceleration along all three axes (X, Y, Z). The 830M1-0050 offers a Â±50g range with a sensitivity of 25mV/g, providing reliable and accurate analog voltage outputs. It integrates a built-in RTD temperature sensor for simultaneous vibration and temperature monitoring, and the onboard MCP3562R 24-bit ADC converts these signals into high-resolution digital data. Communication is made through an SPI interface with additional interrupt and clock functionality for easy integration with a host MCU.",
