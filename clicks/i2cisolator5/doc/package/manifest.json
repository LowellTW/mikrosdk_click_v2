    "short_description": "I2C Isolator 5 Click is a compact add-on board that offers completely isolated bidirectional communication. This board features ISO1644, a hot-swappable bidirectional I2C isolator with enhanced EMC and GPIOs from Texas Instruments. The ISO1644 provides two bidirectional channels, supporting a completely isolated I2C interface that eliminates the need for splitting I2C signals into separate transmit and receive signals for use with standalone optocouplers.",
