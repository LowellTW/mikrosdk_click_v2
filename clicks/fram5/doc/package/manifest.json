    "short_description": "FRAM 5 Click is a compact add-on board representing a highly reliable ferroelectric random access memory solution. This board features the FM24V10, a 1Mbit nonvolatile memory employing an advanced ferroelectric process organized as 128K words of 8 bits each from Infineon. This I2C configurable FRAM performs read and write operations similar to a RAM providing reliable data retention for 151 years while eliminating the complexities, overhead, and system-level reliability problems caused by EEPROM and other nonvolatile memories.",
