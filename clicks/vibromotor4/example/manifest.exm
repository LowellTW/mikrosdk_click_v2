    "description": "Vibro Motor 4 Click is a compact add-on board that makes an ideal solution for adding simple haptic feedback in any design. This board features the G1040003D, a coin-sized linear resonant actuator (LRA) that generates vibration/haptic feedback from Jinlong Machinery & Electronics, Inc. Driven by a flexible Haptic/Vibra driver, the DRV2605, G1040003D vibrates in the Z-axis, which is perpendicular to the face of the vibration motor. It draws a maximum of 170mA while producing the highest G force/vibration energy of 2 GRMS.",
