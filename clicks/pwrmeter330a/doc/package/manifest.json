    "short_description": "PWR Meter 3 Click - 30A is a compact add-on board that measures voltage and current through the connected load. This board features the ACS37800KMACTR-030B3-I2C, an I2C-configurable power monitoring solution from Allegro MicroSystems, which simplifies the addition of power monitoring to many AC/DC powered systems. The ACS37800KMACLU-090B3-I2C Hall-effect-based current sensing technology achieves reinforced isolation ratings (4800 VRMS) alongside a reliable Â±30A bidirectional current sensing. It also has two LED indicators for the realization of visual detection of some anomalies in operation, such as under/overvoltage and fast overcurrent fault detection.",
