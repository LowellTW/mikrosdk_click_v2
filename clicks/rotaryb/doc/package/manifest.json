    "short_description": "Rotary B click carries a 15-pulse incremental rotary encoder with detents, surrounded by a ring of 16 blue LEDs. It’s a perfect solution for adding a precision input knob to your design. The encoder outputs A and B signals (out of phase to each other); the knob also acts as a push-button which sends an interrupt to the target board MCU. The LED ring is controlled through SPI lines (CS, SCK, MISO, MOSI). Rotary click™ can be used with either a 3.3V or 5V power supply.",
