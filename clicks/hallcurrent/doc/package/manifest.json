    "short_description": "Hall Current Click is a compact add-on board that contains a precise solution for AC/DC current sensing. This board features the TLI4970-D050T4, a 16-bit digital SPI output (13-bit current value) coreless magnetic current sensor designed for the current range of Â±25A from Infineon Technology. A differential measurement principle allows effective stray field suppression with a highly linear output signal without hysteresis. Due to the integrated primary conductor (current rail), there is no need for external calibration. The TLI4970-D050T4 is highly accurate over temperature range and lifetime with fast overcurrent detection with a configurable threshold.",
