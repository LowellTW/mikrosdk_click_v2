    "description": "NFC Tag 5 Click is a compact add-on board that contains a compact NFC tag IC. This board features the M24LR64E-R, a dynamic NFC/RFID tag IC with a dual interface 64-Kbit EEPROM from STMicroelectronics. It features an I2C interface alongside an RF contactless interface operating at 13.56MHz, organized as 8192×8 bits in the I2C mode and 2048×32 bits in the ISO 15693 and ISO 18000-3 mode 1 RF mode. The M24LR64E-R also features an energy harvesting analog output and a user-configurable digital output pin, used as an interrupt, toggling during either RF write in progress or RF busy mode.",
