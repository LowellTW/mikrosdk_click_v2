    "short_description": "EEPROM 12 Click is a compact add-on board that contains a highly reliable, nonvolatile memory solution. This board features the M24256E, an EEPROM from STMicroelectronics. It is a 256Kbit (32KB) EEPROM with a page size of 64 bytes and an additional identification page with the same size. This identification page can be read or written and (later) permanently locked in read-only mode and can be used to store sensitive application parameters.",
