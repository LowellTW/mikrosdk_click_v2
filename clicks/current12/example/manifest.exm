    "description": "Current 12 Click is a compact add-on board designed for high-precision monitoring of current, voltage, power, and temperature in various applications. This board features the TSC1641, a 60V 16-bit power monitor with an I2C interface from STMicroelectronics. The TSC1641 consist of a high-precision 16-bit dual-channel sigma-delta ADC, capable of measuring high-side, low-side, and bidirectional currents with a programmable conversion time ranging from 128Âµs to 32.7ms. It supports 2-wire I2C communication with clock frequencies up to 1MHz, and includes an alert interrupt pin for setting thresholds on voltage, current, power, and temperature.",
