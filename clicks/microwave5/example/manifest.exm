    "description": "Microwave 5 Click is a compact add-on board that utilizes the Doppler Shift Phenomenon to sense motion. This board features the PD-V10-G5, a miniature X-band microwave transceiver from Ningbo Pdlux Electronic Technology. The transmitter on this transceiver works on a 10.525GHz frequency over the patch antenna, with a 2-4kHz pulse repetition frequency. The strength of the sensorâ€™s output, in other words, the detection range, depends on the Signal-to-Noise ratio.",
