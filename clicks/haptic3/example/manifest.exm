    "name": "HAPTIC 3 Click",
    "description": "Haptic 3 Click is a compact add-on board that uses advanced vibration patterns and waveforms to convey information to a user. This board features the DA7282, a linear resonant actuator (LRA), and an eccentric rotating mass (ERM) haptic driver from Dialog Semiconductor. The DA7282 features LRA or ERM drive capability with automatic closed-loop LRA resonant frequency tracking, guaranteeing consistency across LRA production tolerances. It also offers wideband operation that fully utilizes the capabilities of newer wideband and multi-directional LRAs, alongside three external general-purpose inputs for triggering up to six independent haptic sequences.",
