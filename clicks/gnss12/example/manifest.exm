    "description": "GNSS 12 Click is a compact add-on board that provides fast positioning capability. This board features the CAM-M8C, a professional-grade GNSS module built on the high-performing M8 GNSS engine from u-blox. This module utilizes concurrent reception of up to three GNSS systems (GPS/Galileo together with either BeiDou or GLONASS), offering high sensitivity and strong signal levels. Besides internal, the CAM-M8C can use an optional external active antenna. It has a configurable host interface, advanced jamming/spoofing detection, and provides outstanding positioning accuracy even in GNSS-hostile environments.",
