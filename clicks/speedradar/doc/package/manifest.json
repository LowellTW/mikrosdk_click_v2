    "short_description": "Speed Radar Click is a compact add-on board that comes with a radar motion detector. This board features the K-LD2, a radar transceiver from RFbeam. It is a 24GHz radar with a detection distance for humans of up to 15m and cars of up to 30m. Its digital structure makes it easy to use in an MCU-based application or as a standalone device where movement detection or even a speed measurement is required.",
