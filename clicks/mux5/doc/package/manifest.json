    "short_description": "MUX 5 Click is a compact add-on board that contains a precise multiplexing solution. This board features the MAX14661, a serially controlled, dual-channel analog multiplexer from Analog Devices, allowing any of the 16 pins to be connected to either common pin simultaneously in any combination. The MAX14661 features Beyond-the-Rails™ capability that allows ±5.5V signals to be passed with any supply configuration alongside a configurable host interface that supports SPI and I2C serial communications. Both modes provide individual control of each independent switch so that any combination of switches can be applied.",
