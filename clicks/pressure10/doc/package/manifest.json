    "short_description": "Pressure 10 Click features a digital interface barometric pressure sensor, based on piezoresistive bridge, labeled as HSPPAD042A, from ALPS Electric. It can use both SPI and I2C communication protocols, allowing it to be interfaced with a broad range of MCUs. Besides the pressure readings, this Click boardâ„¢ also offers very accurate temperature reading, which is required for the pressure readings compensation and can be used in a wide range of battery-powered and portable applications thanks to its very low power consumption.",
