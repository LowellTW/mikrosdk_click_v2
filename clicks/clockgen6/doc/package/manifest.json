    "short_description": "Clock Gen 6 Click is a compact add-on board representing a digital oscillator solution. This board features the MIC1557, an IttyBitty CMOS RC oscillator designed to provide rail-to-rail pulses for precise time delay or frequency generation from Microchip Technology. The MIC1557 has a single threshold and trigger connection, internally connected, for astable (oscillator) operation only. It also has an enable/reset control signal routed to the RST pin of the mikroBUS™ socket, which controls the bias supply to the oscillator’s internal circuitry and optimizes power consumption used for oscillator power ON/OFF purposes. In addition, it provides the ability to select the desired frequency programmed via a digital potentiometer, the MAX5401.",
