    "short_description": "There are many kinds of touch sensors on the market, but every one of them has some unique features that make it stand out from the crowd. TouchKey 3 click is equipped with seven advanced capacitive sensors, based on the proprietary QTouch® technology. Besides quite a large number of QTouch® capacitive sensor channels, TouchKey 3 click also offers some additional features, such as the Adjacent Key Suppression (AKS®), a technology that ensures correct button press, even when the touch sensing pads are placed close to each other.",
