    "short_description": "HZ to V click is a device that can converts input frequency of the signal with virtually any wave shape to a DC voltage output, with a level proportional to the input frequency. It has a linear response, and by applying a signal with the frequency between 1kHz to 10kHz on its input, the Click boardâ„¢ will generate a DC voltage, ranging from 0.33V to 3.3V.",
