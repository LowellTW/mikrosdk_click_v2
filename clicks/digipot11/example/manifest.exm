    "description": "DIGI POT 11 Click is a compact add-on board representing a digitally controlled potentiometer. This board features a double pack of the MAX5387, a dual, 256-tap, volatile, low-voltage linear taper digital potentiometer from Analog Devices. This way, four digitally I2C-controlled potentiometers are realized with end-to-end resistance values of 50kΩ. Operating from a single +3.3V power supply, this device provides a low 35ppm/ºC end-to-end temperature coefficient.",
