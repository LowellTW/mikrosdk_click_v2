    "short_description": "Thermo 26 Click is a compact add-on board that accurately measures temperature. This board features the STS31-DIS, a high-accuracy digital temperature sensor from Sensirion. Characterized by its high accuracy (up to ±0.2°C typical) and high resolution of 0.01°C, the STS31-DIS provides temperature data to the host controller with a configurable I2C interface. It relies on the industry-proven CMOSens® technology, providing increased intelligence, reliability, and improved accuracy specifications, including enhanced signal processing, user-selectable I2C addresses, and up to 1 MHz communication speeds.",
