    "short_description": "Cooler Click is a compact add-on board designed as a cooling solution to manage heat in electronic systems efficiently. This board features the DRV8213, a brushless DC motor driver from Texas Instruments, ensuring a high-performance operation. This board also directly integrates a TMP007 temperature sensor and an MF25060V2-1000U-A99 cooling fan onto its platform, offering a compact and ready-to-use cooling system. It operates across a wide PWM frequency range from 0 to 100kHz, supports both 3.3V and 5V logic levels, and features several protection mechanisms, including undervoltage lockout, overcurrent protection, and overtemperature shutdown.",
