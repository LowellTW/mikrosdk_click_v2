    "short_description": "Temp&Hum 21 Click is a compact add-on board representing temperature and humidity sensing solution. This board features the HIH8130-021-001, a highly accurate, fully-calibrated digital humidity and temperature sensor from Honeywell Sensing and Productivity Solutions. This sensor, characterized by its high accuracy (±2% RH and ±0.5°C over a wide operating temperature range) and high resolution, provides factory-calibrated 14-bit data to the host controller with a configurable I2C interface. It also comes with alarm features with selectable alarm thresholds by an MCU or externally.",
