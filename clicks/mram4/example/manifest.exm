    "description": "MRAM 4 Click is a compact add-on board representing a magneto-resistive random-access memory solution. This board features the EM064LX, an industrial STT-MRAM persistent memory from Everspin Technologies. It is a 64Mb MRAM IC RAM and can achieve up to 200MHz as a single and double data rate (STR/DTR). The MRAM technology is analog to Flash technology with SRAM-compatible read/write timings (Persistent SRAM, P-SRAM), where data is always non-volatile. It also has a hardware write-protection feature and performs read and write operations with data retention for ten years and unlimited read, write, and erase operations for the supported life of the chip.",
