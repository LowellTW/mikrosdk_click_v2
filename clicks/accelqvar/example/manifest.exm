    "description": "Accel&Qvar Click is a compact add-on board for capturing precise acceleration measurements and detecting electric charge variations. This board features the LIS2DUXS12, an ultralow-power accelerometer from STMicroelectronics. Besides low power consumption, it also includes Qvar technology, artificial intelligence, and an anti-aliasing filter. This digital, 3-axis accelerometer has adjustable full scales (±2g to ±16g), output data rates (1.6Hz to 800Hz), and multiple operating modes to serve various applications.",
