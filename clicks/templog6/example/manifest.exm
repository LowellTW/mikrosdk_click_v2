    "description": "Temp-Log 6 click is a temperature sensing Click boardâ„¢, which features the MAX6642, a specifically designed IC, capable of measuring its own die temperature, as well as a temperature at a remote PN junction. This option makes Temp-Log 6 click well-suited for monitoring the temperature of a CPU, GPU or FPGA, where the PN junction is typically a substrate PNP transistor on the die of the measured IC.",
