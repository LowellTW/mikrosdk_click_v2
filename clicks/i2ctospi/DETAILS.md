# I2C to SPI Click

I2C to SPi Click is an all-in-one solution which allows serving as an interface between a standard I2C-bus of a microcontroller and an SPi bus, which allows the microcontroller to communicate directly with SPi devices through its I2C-bus. It is equipped with the stacking headers, so it can be easily connected.

#### Click library 

- **Author**        : MikroE Team
- **Date**          : maj 2020.
- **Type**          : I2C type


# Software Support

We provide a library for the I2cToSpi Click 
as well as a demo application (example), developed using MikroElektronika 
[compilers](https://shop.mikroe.com/compilers). 
The demo can run on all the main MikroElektronika [development boards](https://shop.mikroe.com/development-boards).

Package can be downloaded/installed directly form compilers IDE(recommended way), or downloaded from our LibStock, or found on mikroE github account. 

## Library Description

> This library contains API for I2cToSpi Click driver.

#### Standard key functions :

- Config Object Initialization function.
> void i2ctospi_cfg_setup ( i2ctospi_cfg_t *cfg ); 
 
- Initialization function.
> I2CTOSPI_RETVAL i2ctospi_init ( i2ctospi_t *ctx, i2ctospi_cfg_t *cfg );

- Click Default Configuration function.
> void i2ctospi_default_cfg ( i2ctospi_t *ctx );


#### Example key functions :

- Function SPI write the byte of data to the targeted 8-bit register address of the SC18IS602B I2C-bus to SPI bridge on the I2C to SPI Click board.
> void i2ctospi_spi_write_byte ( i2ctospi_t *ctx, i2ctospi_spi_t *spi, uint8_t write_data );
 
- Function SPI read the byte of data from the targeted 8-bit register address of the SC18IS602B I2C-bus to SPI bridge on the I2C to SPI Click board.
> uint8_t i2ctospi_spi_read_byte ( i2ctospi_t *ctx, i2ctospi_spi_t *spi );

- Function clear interrupt is generated by the SC18IS602B after any SPI transmission has been completed.
> void i2ctospi_clear_interrupt ( i2ctospi_t *ctx );

## Examples Description

> I2C to SPi Click allows serving as an interface between a standard I2C-bus of a microcontroller 
> and an SPi bus, which allows the microcontroller to communicate directly with SPi devices 
> through its I2C-bus. By offering an I2C-bus slave-transmitter or slave-receiver and SPI master, 
> this Click controls all the SPi bus-specific sequences, protocol, and timing. It also has its own 
> internal oscillator, and it supports the SPi chip select output that may be configured as GPIO when not used.

**The demo application is composed of two sections :**

### Application Init 

>  Initialization driver enable's - I2C,
> hardware reset, SS0 ( CS ) configured to be used as slave select outputs, set the configuration of SPI:
> order MSB first, clock Idle low, leading-edge transition, SPI clock rate to 115kHz,
> set SPI EEPROM write enable SS0, clear  interrupt,
> clear RT5 register, sets starting time: hours, minutes and seconds ( enable counting ), also write log. 

```c

void application_init ( void )
{
    log_cfg_t log_cfg;
    i2ctospi_cfg_t cfg;

    /** 
     * Logger initialization.
     * Default baud rate: 115200
     * Default log level: LOG_LEVEL_DEBUG
     * @note If USB_UART_RX and USB_UART_TX 
     * are defined as HAL_PIN_NC, you will 
     * need to define them manually for log to work. 
     * See @b LOG_MAP_USB_UART macro definition for detailed explanation.
     */
    LOG_MAP_USB_UART( log_cfg );
    log_init( &logger, &log_cfg );
    log_info( &logger, "---- Application Init ----" );

    //  Click initialization.

    i2ctospi_cfg_setup( &cfg );
    I2CTOSPI_MAP_MIKROBUS( cfg, MIKROBUS_1 );
    i2ctospi_init( &i2ctospi, &cfg );

    i2ctospi_default_cfg( &i2ctospi );
    
    //Set Time :  23h 59m 48s
    rtc5_clear( &i2ctospi, &i2ctospi_spi );  
    rtc5_set_time_hours( &i2ctospi, &i2ctospi_spi, 23 );
    Delay_1ms( );
    rtc5_set_time_minutes( &i2ctospi, &i2ctospi_spi, 59 );
    Delay_1ms( );
    rtc5_set_time_seconds( &i2ctospi, &i2ctospi_spi, 48 );
    Delay_1ms( );
}
  
```

### Application Task

> This is an example which demonstrates the use of RTC 5 Click is wired to I2C to SPI Click board.
> I2C to SPI Click communicates with register via the I2C interface,
> serve as an interface between a standard I2C-bus of a microcontroller and an SPI bus.
> RTC 5 Click communicates with register via SPI interface.
> In this examples, we display RTC time which we received reading from the target register 
> address of MCP79510 chip on RTC 5 Click board via I2C interface of I2C to SPI Click board.
> Results are being sent to the Usart Terminal where you can track their changes.
> All data logs write on usb uart changes for every 1 sec. 

```c

void application_task ( void )
{
    time_seconds = rtc5_get_time_seconds( &i2ctospi, &i2ctospi_spi );
    Delay_1ms( );
    time_minutes = rtc5_get_time_minutes( &i2ctospi, &i2ctospi_spi );
    Delay_1ms( );
    time_hours = rtc5_get_time_hours( &i2ctospi, &i2ctospi_spi );
    Delay_1ms( );

    if ( time_seconds_new != time_seconds )
    {
        log_printf( &logger, " Time :  " );
    
        display_log_uart( time_hours );
        log_printf( &logger, ":" );
    
        display_log_uart( time_minutes );
        log_printf( &logger, ":" );
    
        display_log_uart( time_seconds );
        log_printf( &logger, "\r\n" );
        
        log_printf( &logger, "------------------\r\n" );

        time_seconds_new = time_seconds;
    }

    Delay_1ms( );

**Additional notes and informations**

Depending on the development board you are using, you may need 
[USB UART Click](https://shop.mikroe.com/usb-uart-click), 
[USB UART 2 Click](https://shop.mikroe.com/usb-uart-2-click) or 
[RS232 Click](https://shop.mikroe.com/rs232-click) to connect to your PC, for 
development systems with no UART to USB interface available on the board. The 
terminal available in all Mikroelektronika 
[compilers](https://shop.mikroe.com/compilers), or any other terminal application 
of your choice, can be used to read the message.
