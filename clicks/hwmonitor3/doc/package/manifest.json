    "short_description": "HW Monitor 3 Click is a compact add-on board designed for precise voltage monitoring and supervision in critical systems. This board features the TPS389006, a six-channel window voltage supervisor IC from Texas Instruments, offering SIL-3 safety compliance. This board features I2C programmability, Â±6mV accuracy, built-in CRC error checking, sequence logging, and an integrated ADC for real-time voltage readouts. It supports fixed window thresholds with fine granularity, undervoltage lockout (UVLO) at 2.48V, and remote sensing to monitor high-current rails accurately.",
