    "short_description": "Stepper 12 Click is a compact add-on board that contains a bipolar stepper motor driver. This board features the TB67S549FTG, a two-phase bipolar stepping motor driver from Toshiba Semiconductor. It supports a PWM constant-current control drive without a current sense resistor for motor-current detection and allows full-step to 1/32 steps resolution for less motor noise and smoother control. It has a wide operating voltage range of 4.5V to 34V with an output current capacity of 1.2A maximum and several anomaly detection indicators.",
