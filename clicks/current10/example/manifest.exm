    "description": "Current 10 Click is a compact add-on board designed for reliable current measurements. This board features the CT455, an XtremeSense™ TMR coreless current sensor from Allegro Microsystems, with a wide 1MHz bandwidth and a sensitivity of 333.3mV/mT, capable of detecting both positive and negative current flows (±6mT). It translates magnetic fields into a linear analog output with less than ±1.0% error across temperature and supply voltage variations.",
