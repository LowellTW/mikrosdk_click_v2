    "short_description": "Rotary R 2 Click is a compact add-on board that allows you to add a precision input knob to your design. This board features the TLC5925, a low-power 16-channel constant-current LED sink driver from Texas Instruments that, combined with a high-quality rotary encoder from ALPS, the EC12D1564402, allows you to add a precision input knob to your design. It also features an LED ring composed of 16 individual red LEDs that can visually represent the encoder position and more.",
