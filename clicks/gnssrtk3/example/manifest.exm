    "description": "GNSS RTK 3 Click is a compact add-on board that enhances the precision of position data derived from satellite-based positioning systems. This board features the LC29H, a dual-band, multi-castellation GNSS module from Quectel. This module supports the concurrent reception of all five global GNSS constellations: GPS, BDS, Galileo, GZSS, and GLONASS. It can receive and track many visible satellites in multi-bands, significantly mitigating the multipath effect in deep urban canyons and improving positioning accuracy.",
