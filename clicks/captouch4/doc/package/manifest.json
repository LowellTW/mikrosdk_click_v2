    "short_description": "Cap Touch 4 Click is a compact add-on board for wake-on-touch and activation applications. This board features the IQS211B, a single-channel capacitive controller from Azoteq, featuring ProxSenseÂ® technology for highly sensitive self-capacitance measurements. The board includes a defined circular touch-sensing area, signal conditioning for parasitic capacitance, and a low-power Sleep mode with wake-up functionality, ensuring efficient energy consumption. It communicates via the I2C interface with a fixed address of 0x47, operates at 3.3V logic, and features the new Click Snap for added flexibility.",
