    "description": "ISO ADC 6 Click is a compact add-on board that contains an eight-channel isolated ADC. This board features the AD7124-8, an 8-channel, low noise, low power, 24-bit, sigma-delta ADC from Analog Devices. The ADC has a programmable gain array (PGA) that allows gains of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128. Additionally, the ADC contains a 2.5V reference, which can be used with reference buffers, along with the externally applied references. The host MCU is isolated from the ADC by the ADuM341E, a 5kVrms quad digital isolator from Analog Devices.",
