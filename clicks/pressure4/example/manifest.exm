    "name": "Pressure 4 Click",
    "description": "Pressure 4 click is an absolute barometric pressure measurement Click boardâ„¢, which features a low power consumption, high precision barometric pressure sensor. Capable of using both SPI and I2C communication protocols, Pressure 4 click allows being interfaced with a broad range of various microcontroller units (MCUs). The sensor used on this Click boardâ„¢ features onboard processing capabilities, such as the IIR filtering, used to filter out abrupt changes of pressure. Low power consumption allows Pressure 4 click to be used in many portable, battery-powered applications.",
