    "description": "Accel 24 Click is a compact add-on board that contains an acceleration sensor. This board features the MXC6655XA, a 12-bit three-axis accelerometer from MEMSIC. It allows selectable full-scale acceleration measurements in ranges of ±2g, ±4g, or ±8g in three axes with a compatible I2C serial interface with 400KHz fast mode operation. Alongside low offset and temperature signal with high accuracy, the MXC6655XA also detects six orientation positions, X/Y shake, and shake directions with an appropriate interrupt signal for these states.",
