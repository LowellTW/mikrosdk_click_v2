    "description": "Thermo 28 Click is a compact add-on board that accurately measures temperature. This board features the ams AG’s AS6221, a high-accuracy digital temperature sensor. The AS6221 consists of a Si bandgap temperature factory-calibrated sensor, 16-bit ADC, and a digital signal processor, offering a high accuracy of ±0.9°C. It provides temperature data to the host controller through a compatible I2C interface, reliability, user-selectable I2C addresses, and alert functionality, which triggers an interrupt to protect the device from excessive temperatures.",
