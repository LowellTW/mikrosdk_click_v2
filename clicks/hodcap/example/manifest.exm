    "description": "HOD CAP Click is a compact add-on board that adds a smart sensing solution to your application. This board features the AS8579, a capacitive sensor from ams OSRAM. The sensor features I/Q signal demodulation, parasitic influences from cable, and PCB protection. It has ten sense outputs, five of which come with sensing line filter circuits. This Click boardâ„¢ makes the perfect solution for the development of autonomous driving applications such as hands-on steering wheel detection and detection of any human presence inside a vehicle or outside of the vehicle, e.g., for automatic trunk opener and more.",
