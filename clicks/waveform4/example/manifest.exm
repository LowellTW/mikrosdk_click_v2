    "description": "Waveform 4 Click is a compact add-on board that represents a high-performance signal generator. This board features the AD9106, a quad-channel, 12-bit, 180MSPS waveform generator, integrating on-chip static random access memory (SRAM) and direct digital synthesis (DDS) for complex waveform generation from Analog Devices. The DDS is up to a 180 MHz master clock sinewave generator with a 24-bit tuning word allowing 10.8 Hz/LSB frequency resolution.",
