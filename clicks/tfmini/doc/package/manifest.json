    "short_description": "TFmini Click is an adapter Click board™ used to interface a compatible ToF (Time of Flight) LiDAR sensor with the host MCU. This board features one four positions 1.25mm connector suitable for a TFmini LiDAR module (TFmini Plus and TFmini-S) specially made to measure an object's distance. Depending on the used LiDAR module, it is possible to achieve different measurement ranges and the use of a different serial interface, such as the UART or I2C. This Click board™ is suitable for various industrial environments like pedestrian detection, vehicle testing, and altitude.",
