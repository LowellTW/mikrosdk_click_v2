    "description": "HAPTIC 2 Click is a compact add-on board that contains a linear vibration driver. This board features the LC898302AXA, a motor driver dedicated to LRA and ERM applications from ON Semiconductor. Controlled by only one pin, it allows crisp vibration thanks to automatic braking and over-driving feature and ignores the deviation of resonance frequency thanks to auto-tuning function. The original driving waveform will enable you to reduce power consumption, and it is helpful to maintain battery lifetime.",
