    "description": "6DOF IMU 21 Click is a compact add-on board perfect for applications requiring accurate orientation and movement detection. This board features the WSEN-ISDS (2536030320001) sensor from Würth Elektronik, which integrates 3-axis acceleration and gyroscope sensors using advanced MEMS-based capacitive sensing technology. It offers a fully calibrated 16-bit digital output, with acceleration ranges from ±2g to ±16g and gyroscope ranges from ±125dps to ±2000dps, alongside a high output data rate of up to 6.6kHz for seamless movement tracking. Additionally, an embedded temperature sensor provides environmental monitoring capabilities.",
