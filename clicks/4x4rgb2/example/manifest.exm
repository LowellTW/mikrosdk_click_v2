    "description": "4x4 RGB 2 Click is a compact add-on board that contains a matrix of 16 intelligent RGB LEDs, forming a 4x4 display screen. This board features 16 IN-PC55TBTRGB, 5x5mm RGB LEDs with an integrated IC from Inolux. The LEDs feature an 8-bit color control in 256 steps (256-level greyscale) and a 5-bit brightness control in 32 steps. The intelligent LEDs are cascaded (daisy-chained); thus, every one of them can communicate with the host MCU using the same data lines.",
