    "short_description": "DC Motor 9 Click is a brushed DC motor driver with the current limiting and current sensing. It is based on the DRV8871, an integrated H-Bridge driver IC, optimized for motor driving applications. It can be operated by two logic signals, allowing to drive the connected motor in two different ways: it can use fixed logic levels for the direction control, or it can be controlled by a PWM signal, offering an additional speed control option. The DRV8871 also contains a set of protection features, offering a very high level of reliability. Besides driving capabilities, DC Motor 9 click can also sense current consumption at its output.",
