    "description": "ADC 11 Click is a compact add-on board that contains a high-performance data converter. This board features the LTC1864, a 16-bit 250ksps analog-to-digital converter from Analog Devices. With a typical supply current of only 850µA at the maximum sampling frequency, the LTC1864 is among the lowest power consumption ADCs available. After conversion, the LTC1864 goes into a low-power Sleep mode, further reducing the supply current. That’s why it can run at proper micro-power levels in applications that do not require the maximum sampling rate of the LTC1864.",
