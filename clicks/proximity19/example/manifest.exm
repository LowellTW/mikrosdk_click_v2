    "description": "Proximity 19 Click is a compact add-on board designed for precise proximity sensing in various applications. This board features the RPR-0720, a digital optical proximity sensor from ROHM Semiconductor. The RPR-0720 integrates an infrared VCSEL (IrVCSEL) and an IC with an I2C interface, featuring a detection range adjustable from 1 to 15mm and an ambient light canceling function. The board uses a 2-wire I2C interface for communication, supporting up to 400kHz frequency clock, allowing control over sensor functions such as operating mode, interrupt system, and offset/threshold adjustments.",
