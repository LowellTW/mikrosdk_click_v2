    "description": "Illuminance Click is a compact add-on board that mimics how humans perceive light. This board features ams AGâ€™s TSL2583, a very-high sensitivity light-to-digital converter that transforms light intensity to a digital signal output capable of the direct I2C interface. It combines one broadband photodiode (visible plus infrared) and one infrared-responding photodiode on a single CMOS integrated circuit capable of providing a near-photopic response over an effective 16-bit dynamic range (16-bit resolution).",
