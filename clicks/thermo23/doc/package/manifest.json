    "short_description": "Thermo 23 Click is a compact add-on board that provides an accurate temperature measurement. This board features the TMP144, a high-precision digital temperature sensor from Texas Instruments. The temperature sensor in the TMP144 is the chip itself, that houses temperature sensor circuitry, 12-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC), a control logic, and a serial interface block in one package. Characterized by its high accuracy (up to Â±0.5Â°C typical) and high resolution of 0.0625Â°C, this temperature sensor provides temperature data to the host controller with a configurable UART interface.",
