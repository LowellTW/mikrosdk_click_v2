    "short_description": "Gyro 8 Click is a compact add-on board that contains a high-performance gyroscope. This board features Murata's SCR2100-D08, a high-performance single-axis angular rate sensor (gyroscope). Based on Murata's proven capacitive 3D-MEMS technology, the SCR2100-D08 is characterized by high stability and reliability, providing immensely stable output over a wide range of temperatures, humidity, and vibration. This high-resolution gyroscope supports ±125°/s X-axis angular rate measurement range, extensive self-diagnostic features, an SPI serial interface, and low power consumption.",
