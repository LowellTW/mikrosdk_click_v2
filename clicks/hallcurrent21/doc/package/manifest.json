    "short_description": "Hall Current 21 Click is a compact add-on board designed for precise current measurement across a wide frequency range, ideal for fast and accurate monitoring applications. This board features the ACS37030, a galvanically-isolated current sensor from Allegro Microsystems. It provides bidirectional current sensing with a range of ±65A and a sensitivity of 20.3mV/A, offering high isolation of 3500VRMS and a working voltage of up to 840VRMS. It also features low noise and a wide operating bandwidth, making it suitable for high-speed switching current and control loop monitoring. This Click board™ is perfect for power supplies in servers, data centers, and solar DC-DC converters.",
