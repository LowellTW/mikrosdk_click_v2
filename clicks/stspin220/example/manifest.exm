    "name": "STSPIN220 Click",
    "description": "STSPIN220 click is a stepper motor driver with the PWM current control and selectable microstepping up to 256 microsteps. It is based on the STSPIN220, a low voltage stepper motor driver from STSPIN2 series. It is optimized for battery-powered, low voltage motor driving applications, featuring the lowest standby current available on the market (max 80 nA). The STSPIN220 is a high-efficiency motor driver, featuring low ON resistance MOSFETs as the output stage, in a small 3x3mm QFN package. Its output stage implements the PWM current control with fixed OFF time, along with a full set of protection features. The device can be used with the step motor voltage ranging from 1.8V to 10V, and current up to 1.3A per bridge.",
