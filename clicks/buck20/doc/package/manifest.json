    "short_description": "Buck 20 Click is a compact add-on board that contains a DC-DC power converter that steps down the voltage from its input to its output. This board features the MP2316, a fully-integrated, high-efficiency, synchronous, step-down switch-mode converter from Monolithic Power Systems (MPS). The MP2316 achieves 3A continuous output current over a wide input supply range from 4V to 19V. It has excellent load and line regulation and can operate efficiently over a vast output voltage load range. The MP2316 also offers advanced protection features such as undervoltage, overcurrent, and short-circuit detections.",
