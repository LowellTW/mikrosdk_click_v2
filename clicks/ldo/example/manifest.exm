    "description": "LDO Click is a compact add-on board designed to regulate the output voltage of a power supply to a lower level with a very low dropout voltage. This board features the TPS7A83A, a low-noise, low-dropout linear regulator (LDO) from Texas Instruments capable of sourcing 2A with only 200mV of maximum dropout. The TPS7A8300A has a pin-programmable output voltage from 0.8V-3.95V with a 50mV resolution, or it can be adjustable from 0.8V-5.2V using an external resistor divider.",
