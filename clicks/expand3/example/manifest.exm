    "description": "Expand 3 Click is a compact add-on board providing general-purpose I/O expansion. This board features the DS2408, an 8-channel programmable I/O expander from Analog Devices. The DS2408 has a factory-lasered 64-bit registration number, enabling multiple Expand 3 Click boards™ to be connected on the same data line, communicating with the host MCU through a standard Dallas Semiconductor 1-Wire interface (15.3kbps or 100kbps). PIO outputs are configured as open-drain and provide a maximum on-resistance of 100Ω.",
