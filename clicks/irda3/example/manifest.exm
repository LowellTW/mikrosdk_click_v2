    "description": "IrDA 3 Click is an intelligent IR transceiver device that can both send and receive UART commands via the IR interface. IrDA 3 Click features both the IR transceiver and the encoder/decoder IC, used to convert the UART data and send or receive it in IrDAÂ® compatible format. IrDA 3 Click also has an onboard clock generator for the fastest possible UART performance of 115,200 bps, so it does not need an additional clock signal to be generated by the MCU.",
