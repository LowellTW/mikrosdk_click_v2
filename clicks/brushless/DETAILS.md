# Brushless click

Brushless click carries Toshiba's TB6575FNG IC for driving 3-phase full-wave Brushless DC motors â€” which are ideal for powering flying drones. The click is able to safely drive external motors with up to 32V/2A. The board features three pairs of onboard screw terminals. VBAT is for connecting an external 7-32V DC power supply.

#### Click library 

- **Author**        : Nikola peric
- **Date**          : Feb 2022.
- **Type**          : PWM type

# Software Support

We provide a library for the Brushless Click 
as well as a demo application (example), developed using MikroElektronika 
[compilers](https://shop.mikroe.com/compilers). 
The demo can run on all the main MikroElektronika [development boards](https://shop.mikroe.com/development-boards).

Package can be downloaded/installed directly form compilers IDE(recommended way), or downloaded from our LibStock, or found on mikroE github account. 

## Library Description

> This library contains API for Brushless Click driver.

#### Standard key functions :

- Config Object Initialization function.
> void brushless_cfg_setup ( brushless_cfg_t *cfg ); 
 
- Initialization function.
> BRUSHLESS_RETVAL brushless_init ( brushless_t *ctx, brushless_cfg_t *cfg );

- Click Default Configuration function.
> void brushless_default_cfg ( brushless_t *ctx );


#### Example key functions :

- This function sets the spin direction of the motor to clockwise.
> void brushless_spin_clockwise ( brushless_t *ctx );
 
- This function sets the spin direction of the motor to counter clockwise.
> void brushless_spin_counter_clockwise ( brushless_t *ctx );

- This function reads the digital input of the INT pin.
> uint8_t brushless_read_rotation_speed_sensor_output ( brushless_t *ctx );

## Examples Description

>  This example showcases how to initialize and use the Brushless click. 
>  The click has a brushless motor driver which controls the work 
>  of the motor through the BLDC terminal. 
>  In order for this example to work a motor and a power supply are needed.

**The demo application is composed of two sections :**

### Application Init 

> This function initializes and configures the logger and click modules. 

```c

void application_init ( )
{
    log_cfg_t log_cfg;
    brushless_cfg_t cfg;

    /** 
     * Logger initialization.
     * Default baud rate: 115200
     * Default log level: LOG_LEVEL_DEBUG
     * @note If USB_UART_RX and USB_UART_TX 
     * are defined as HAL_PIN_NC, you will 
     * need to define them manually for log to work. 
     * See @b LOG_MAP_USB_UART macro definition for detailed explanation.
     */
    LOG_MAP_USB_UART( log_cfg );
    log_init( &logger, &log_cfg );
    log_info( &logger, "---- Application Init ----" );
    Delay_ms ( 100 );

    //  Click initialization.
    brushless_cfg_setup( &cfg );
    BRUSHLESS_MAP_MIKROBUS( cfg, MIKROBUS_1 );
    Delay_ms ( 100 );
    
    brushless_init( &brushless, &cfg );
    brushless_pwm_start( &brushless );
    log_info( &logger, "---- Application Task ----" );
    Delay_ms ( 1000 );
}
  
```

### Application Task

>  This is an example that demonstrates the use of a Brushless Click board.
>  Brushless Click communicates with the register via the PWM interface.
>  It shows moving in the left direction from slow to fast speed
>  and from fast to slow speed.
>  Results are being sent to the Usart Terminal where you can track their changes.

```c

void application_task ( )
{    
    static int8_t duty_cnt = 1;
    static int8_t duty_inc = 1;
    float duty = duty_cnt / 10.0;

    if ( brushless_direction == 1 )
    {
        brushless_spin_clockwise ( &brushless );
        log_printf( &logger, "<<<< " );
    }
    else
    {
        brushless_spin_counter_clockwise ( &brushless );
        log_printf( &logger, ">>>> " );
    }

    brushless_set_duty_cycle ( &brushless, duty );
    log_printf( &logger, "Duty: %d%%\r\n", ( uint16_t )( duty_cnt * 10 ) );
    Delay_ms ( 500 );

    if ( 10 == duty_cnt ) 
    {
        duty_inc = -1;
    }
    else if ( 0 == duty_cnt ) 
    {
        duty_inc = 1;
                
        if ( brushless_direction == 1 )
        {
            brushless_direction = 0;
        }
        else if ( brushless_direction == 0 )
        {
            brushless_direction = 1;
        }
    }
    duty_cnt += duty_inc;
}

```

The full application code, and ready to use projects can be  installed directly form compilers IDE(recommneded) or found on LibStock page or mikroE GitHub accaunt.

**Other mikroE Libraries used in the example:** 

- MikroSDK.Board
- MikroSDK.Log
- Click.Brushless

**Additional notes and informations**

Depending on the development board you are using, you may need 
[USB UART click](https://shop.mikroe.com/usb-uart-click), 
[USB UART 2 Click](https://shop.mikroe.com/usb-uart-2-click) or 
[RS232 Click](https://shop.mikroe.com/rs232-click) to connect to your PC, for 
development systems with no UART to USB interface available on the board. The 
terminal available in all Mikroelektronika 
[compilers](https://shop.mikroe.com/compilers), or any other terminal application 
of your choice, can be used to read the message.
