    "short_description": "RS232 3 Click is a compact add-on board representing a universal usable RS232 transceiver. This board features the SP3221E, a low-power RS232 transceiver from MaxLinear. The SP3221E uses an internal high-efficiency, charge-pump power supply and is compliant with EIA/TIA-232-F standards when powered by any of the mikroBUSâ„¢ power rails. The AUTO ON-LINEÂ® feature allows the SP3221E to automatically Wake-Up from a Shutdown state when an RS232 cable is connected and a peripheral device is turned on. When not connected or not in use, the SP3221E will automatically shut down, drawing less supply current.",
