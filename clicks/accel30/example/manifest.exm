    "description": "Accel 30 Click is a compact add-on board that contains an acceleration sensor. This board features the MC3635, an ultra-low power, low-noise, integrated digital output 3-axis accelerometer from MEMSIC. The MC3635 allows selectable full-scale acceleration measurements in ranges of ±2g, ±4g, ±8g, ±12g, or ±16g in three axes with a configurable host interface that supports both SPI and I2C serial communication. It also supports high-resolution, low-power operating modes and interrupt feature for various events allowing maximum flexibility to meet multiple use case needs.",
