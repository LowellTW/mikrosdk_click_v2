    "description": "IR 2 Click is a compact add-on board representing a compact and easy solution for adding infrared (IR) remote control to your design. This board features the TSMP58138, a miniaturized sensor for receiving the modulated signal of QEE113 IR emitting diode from Vishay Semiconductors. This IR sensor module consists of a photodetector, pre-amplifier, and automatic gain control to surpass ambient noise with signals transmitted to it in the near-infrared range with a wavelength of 940nm. It also communicates with the target MCU via selectable GPIO lines.",
