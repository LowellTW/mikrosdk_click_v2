    "description": "DIGI POT 9 Click is a compact add-on board used as a digitally controlled potentiometer. This board features the AD5235, a dual-channel, nonvolatile memory, digitally controlled potentiometer from Analog Devices. The AD5235's versatile programming via an SPI-compatible serial interface allows multiple modes of operation and adjustment. The resistor wiper position is determined by the RDAC register contents, which act as a scratchpad register, allowing unlimited changes of resistance settings. The nominal resistance of the RDAC between terminal A and terminal B (RAB) is 250 kÎ© with 1024 positions (10-bit resolution).",
