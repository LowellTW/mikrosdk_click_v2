    "description": "IR Gesture 3 Click is a compact add-on board that provides contactless gesture recognition. This board features the ADPD1080, a photometric front-end from Analog Devices. The IR Gesture 3 Click allows gesture recognition in two dimensions, with a built-in optical filter and a sharp visible light cutoff. It eliminates the need for external lenses and preserves the dynamic range of the sensor when placed under sunlight or indoor lighting. It does not require a precise alignment because its sensor maintains a linear response within the ±35° angular field of view.",
