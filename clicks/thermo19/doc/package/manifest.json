    "short_description": "Thermo 19 Click is a compact add-on board that provides an accurate temperature measurement. This board features the MAX31825, a temperature sensor that provides 8-bit to 12-bit Celsius temperature measurements with better than ±1.75°C from -45°C to +145°C from Analog Devices. It has a unique 64-bit serial code stored in an on-chip ROM, an alarm output for detection of temperature faults, temperature resolution selection from 8 to 12 bits, and it allows temperature conversion to 10-bit digital word in a period of 80ms (max).",
