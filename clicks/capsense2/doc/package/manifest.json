    "short_description": "CapSense 2 Click is a compact add-on board that easily integrates projected capacitive touch into user's applications. This board features the CAP1114, a multi-channel capacitive touch sensor that takes human body capacitance as an input and directly provides the real-time sensor information via the I2C serial interface from Microchip. This board contains capacitive sensing elements, a 7-segment slider, two buttons, and four LED indicators that visually detect the activation on some of these parts. This Click boardâ„¢ offers reliable and accurate sensing for any application that uses capacitive touch sensing functions.",
