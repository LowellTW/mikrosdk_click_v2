    "description": "ADC 16 Click is a compact add-on board that contains a high-performance data converter. This board features the ADS7142-Q1, a low-power two-channel 12-bit analog-to-digital converter from Texas Instruments. This I2C configurable 140kSPS successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) can autonomously monitor signals while maximizing system power, reliability, and performance. It implements event-triggered interrupts per channel using a digital window comparator with programmable high and low thresholds, hysteresis, and event counter.",
