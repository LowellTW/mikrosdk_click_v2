    "description": "Thermo 24 Click is a compact add-on board that contains the 4th generation temperature sensing solution from Sensirion. This board features the STS40, a high-accuracy ultra-low-power temperature sensor. The STS40 integrates a digital temperature sensor with a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC), a data processing circuit, and serial interface logic functions in one package. Characterized by its high accuracy (up to ±0.2°C typical) and high resolution of 0.01°C, this temperature sensor provides temperature data to the host controller with a configurable I2C interface.",
