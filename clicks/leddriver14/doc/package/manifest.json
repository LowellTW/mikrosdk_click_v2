    "short_description": "LED Driver 14 Click is a compact add-on board that simplifies the control of multiple LEDs. This board features the BD18337EFV-M, a reliable four-channel constant current LED driver from Rohm Semiconductor. It is powered by an external power supply in the range of 5.5V to 20V, providing a maximum output current of 150mA per channel. The BD18337EFV-M also comes with the possibility for up to 3 LEDs in series on its output OUTx pin and built-in energy sharing control, selectable operational mode, and multiple built-in protection functions that protect the circuit during abnormalities. This Click boardâ„¢ is ideal for LED rear lamps (turn/stop), fog lamps, and turn signals for automotive applications.",
