    "short_description": "DRAM Click is a compact add-on board representing a dynamic random-access memory solution. This board features the APS6404L-3SQR, 64Mb high-performance SPI/QPI PSRAM memory organized as 8M x 8 bits each from AP Memory. This Pseudo-SRAM device features a high speed, low pin count interface and incorporates a seamless self-managed refresh mechanism to maximize the performance of memory read operation. It has 4 SDR I/O pins and operates in SPI or QPI (quad peripheral interface) mode with frequencies up to 133 MHz.",
