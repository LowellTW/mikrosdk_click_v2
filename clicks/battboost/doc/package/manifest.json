    "short_description": "BATT Boost Click is a compact add-on board that expands a coin battery cell's lifetime and current capability, like the CR2032 and lithium thionyl batteries. This board features the NBM5100A, a coin-cell battery life booster with adaptive power optimization from Nexperia. It is a battery energy management device designed to maximize usable capacity from non-rechargeable, primary batteries when used in low-voltage, low-power applications requiring burst current loads. The devices overcome voltage drop and battery life limitations associated with extracting high pulse currents.",
