    "short_description": "Accel 21 Click is a compact add-on board that contains an acceleration sensor. This board features the MIS2DH, a high-performance three-axis accelerometer from STMicroelectronics. The MIS2DH allows selectable full-scale acceleration measurements in ranges of ±2g, ±4g, ±8g, or ±16g in three axes with a configurable host interface that supports both SPI and I2C serial communication. It also supports high-resolution and low-power operating modes, allowing maximum flexibility to meet various use case needs.",
