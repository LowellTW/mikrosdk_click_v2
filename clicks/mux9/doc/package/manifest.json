    "short_description": "MUX 9 Click is a compact add-on board that contains a precise multiplexing solution. This board features the ADG1438, a CMOS 8-channel analog matrix switch with a high-speed serially controlled 4-wire interface from Analog Devices. Each switch is software-controlled (by a bit of the appropriate register) and conducts equally well in both directions, making it ideal for mux/demux applications. It is specified for a wide supply range ±15V/+12V/±5V where all channels exhibit break-before-make switching action, preventing momentary shorting when switching channels.",
