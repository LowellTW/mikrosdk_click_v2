    "short_description": "Temp ISO Click is a compact add-on board for accurate and isolated temperature measurements in high-voltage environments. This board features the ISOTMP35-Q1, an automotive-grade isolated temperature sensor with analog output from Texas Instruments. This sensor integrates a robust isolation barrier with a withstand voltage of up to 3000VRMS, a linear analog output with a 10mV/°C slope, and a wide temperature range of –40°C to 150°C. It delivers high accuracy of ±2.0°C, fast thermal response, and is AEC-Q100 qualified, ensuring long-term reliability in demanding conditions. The board also features Click Snap, enabling flexible sensor placement by detaching the PCB for standalone operation.",
