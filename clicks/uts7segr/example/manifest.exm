    "description": "7-segment LED display is the most commonly used type of display to represent changing numerical values. The principle is very simple - seven LED segments are positioned in a certain shape and by turning specific segments on or off, the shape that resembles a specific number is lit. This method of displaying numbers was first used in the beginning of the 20th century, but after the invention of the LED in â€˜70, it is the most commonly used method to display numbers. It utilizes a fairly simple and cheap design with the numbers clearly visible.",
