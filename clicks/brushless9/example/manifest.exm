    "description": "Brushless 9 Click is a compact add-on board suitable for controlling BLDC motors with any MCU. This board features the TC78B027FTG, a 1-Hall sine-wave PWM controller for three-phase brushless DC motors from Toshiba Semiconductor. It simplifies the motor selection by using only one Hall sensor input that can be used with either a single Hall sensor motor or the more conventional 3 Hall sensor motors.",
