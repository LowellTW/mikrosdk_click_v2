    "short_description": "Brushless 24 Click is a compact add-on board that controls brushless DC (BLDC) motors with any MCU. This board features the DRV10866, a 3- phase sensorless motor driver from Texas Instruments with integrated power MOSFETs with current drive capability up to 800mA peak. The DRV10866 implements a 150Â° commutation (sensorless BEMF control scheme) for a 3-phase motor alongside a synchronous rectification mode of operation that achieves increased efficiency for motor driver applications. Besides choosing the motor speed and a wide operating voltage range of up to 5V, it also has several built-in protection circuits, such as undervoltage, lock detection, voltage surge protection, and overtemperature.",
