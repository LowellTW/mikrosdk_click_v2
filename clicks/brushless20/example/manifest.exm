    "name": "Brushless 20 Click",
    "description": "Brushless 20 Click is a compact add-on board that controls brushless DC (BLDC) motors with any MCU. This board features the DRV8313, a fully integrated three-phase BLDC motor driver from Texas Instruments. It provides three individually controllable half-H-bridge drivers intended to drive a three-phase BLDC motor, solenoids, or other loads. Each output driver channel consists of N-channel power MOSFETs configured in a 1/2-H-bridge configuration. Besides, it has a wide operating voltage range from 8V to 60V, alongside several built-in protection circuits such as undervoltage, charge pump faults, overcurrent, and overtemperature.",
