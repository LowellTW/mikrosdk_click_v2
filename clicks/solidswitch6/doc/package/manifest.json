    "short_description": "SolidSwitch 6 Click is a compact add-on board for reliable load management in automotive power distribution systems. This board features the VNF1048F, a high-side switch controller with intelligent e-fuse protection from STMicroelectronics. This board supports an input voltage range of 6V to 48V, controls external MOSFET, and offers essential protection features such as overcurrent, under-voltage, and thermal shutdown, with diagnostic feedback via SPI. It also includes an NTC resistor for monitoring MOSFET temperature and operates with either 3.3V or 5V logic levels.",
