    "short_description": "USB-C Sink 2 Click is a compact add-on board with a standalone autonomous USB power delivery controller. This board features the AP33772, a high-performance USB PD sink controller from Diodes Incorporated. It supports dead battery mode to allow a system to be powered from an external source directly, establishes a valid source-to-sink connection, and negotiates a USB power delivery (PD) contract with a PD-capable source device. It also supports a flexible PD3.0 and PPS for applications that require direct voltage and current requests, with fine-tuning capabilities.",
