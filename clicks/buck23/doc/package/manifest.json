    "short_description": "Buck 23 Click is a compact add-on board with a DC-DC power converter that steps down the voltage from its input to its output. This board features the MAX20010C, a fully-integrated, high-efficiency, synchronous, step-down converter from Analog Devices. The MAX20010C achieves 6A continuous output current over a wide input supply range from 3V to 5.5V. It offers Â±2% output voltage accuracy and can operate efficiently over interface-configurable output voltage load range from 0.5V to 1.58V. The MAX20010C also offers programmable soft-start, overcurrent, and overtemperature protections.",
