    "short_description": "Magnetic Rotary 4 Click is a compact add-on board for accurate magnet-position sensing. This board features the AS5047D, an SPI-configurable high-resolution rotary position sensor for fast absolute angle measurement over a full 360-degree range from ams AG. The AS5047D is equipped with revolutionary integrated dynamic angle error compensation (DAECâ„¢) with almost 0 latency and offers a robust design that suppresses the influence of any homogenous external stray magnetic field. It also comes with an onboard header reserved for incremental and commutation signals of their respective A/B/I and U/V/W signals alongside embedded self-diagnostics, including magnetic field strength, lost magnet, and other related diagnostic features.",
