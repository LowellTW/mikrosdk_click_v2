    "description": "IR Grid 4 Click is a compact add-on board for high-precision, non-contact temperature measurement and thermal imaging. This board is based on the MLX90641, a fully calibrated thermal IR array from Melexis. It captures temperature data across a 16x12 matrix (192 pixels) and accurately measures temperatures from -40°C to +300°C with a typical accuracy of 1°C. The board supports the innovative 'Click Snap' feature, allowing the sensor area to be detached for flexible positioning.",
