    "short_description": "DAC 15 Click is a compact add-on board that provides a highly accurate digital-to-analog conversion on two channels. This board features the DAC80502, a dual 16-bit 1-LSB INL voltage-output DAC from Texas Instruments. The DAC operates at a wide power supply range and is a low-power device with as low as 1mA per channel at 5.5V. It also includes a 2.5V, 5-ppm/Â°C internal reference, giving a full-scale voltage buffered output ranges of 1.25V, 2.5V, and 5.5V.",
