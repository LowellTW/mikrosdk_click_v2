    "short_description": "Inclinometer 2 Click is a compact add-on board that measures the orientation angle of an object with respect to the force of gravity. This board features the IIS2ICLX, high accuracy, and resolution two-axis inclinometer from STMicroelectronics. It allows selectable full-scale measurements in ranges of ±0.5/±1/±2/±3g in two axes with a configurable host interface that supports both SPI and I2C serial communication. The sensing element is manufactured using a dedicated micromachining process developed by STMicroelectronics to produce inertial sensors and actuators on silicon wafers.",
