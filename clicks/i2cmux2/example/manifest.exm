    "description": "I2C MUX 2 Click is a quad bidirectional translating I2C and SMBus switch with reset and interrupt functions, intended for applications with I2C slave address conflicts. It features a quad bidirectional translating switch controlled via the I2C bus, labeled as TCA9545A from Texas Instruments. Four interrupt inputs (INT3â€“INT0), one for each of the downstream pairs, are provided on click board. One interrupt (INT) output acts as an AND of the four interrupt inputs.",
