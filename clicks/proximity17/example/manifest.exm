    "description": "Proximity 17 Click is a compact add-on board that contains a close-range proximity sensing solution. This board features the TMD2635, a miniature proximity sensor module from ams AG. The TMD2635 features advanced proximity measurement in a tiny and thin optical land grid array module that incorporates a 940nm infrared vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (IR VCSEL) factory calibrated for IR proximity response. It also offers advanced crosstalk noise cancellation through a wide range of offset adjustments through a digital fast-mode I2C interface to compensate for unwanted IR energy reflection at the sensor. This Click boardâ„¢ is suitable for consumer and industrial applications.",
