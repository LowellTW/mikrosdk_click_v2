This board features the BQ35100, battery fuel gauge, and end-of-service monitor from Texas Instruments. The BQ35100 provides highly configurable fuel gauging for non-rechargeable (primary) lithium batteries without requiring a forced battery discharge. It uses patented TI gauging algorithms to support the option to replace an old battery with a new one seamlessly. It provides accurate results with ultra-low average power consumption, alongside an I2C interface through which the host can read the gathered data.",
