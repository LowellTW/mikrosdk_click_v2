    "description": "6DOF IMU 6 Click features a 6-axis MotionTracking device that combines a 3-axis gyroscope, a 3-axis accelerometer, and a Digital Motion Processorâ„¢ (DMP) labeled as ICM-20689. The ICM-20689 from company TDK InvenSense includes on-chip 16-bit ADCs, programmable digital filters, an embedded temperature sensor, and programmable interrupts. The gyroscope and accelerometer are full-scale range, user-programmable sensors with factory-calibrated initial sensitivity for reduced production-line calibration requirements.",
