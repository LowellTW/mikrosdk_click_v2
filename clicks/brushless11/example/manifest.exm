    "description": "Brushless 11 Click is a compact add-on board that controls brushless DC motors with any MCU. This board features the A4931, a 3-phase brushless DC motor pre-driver from Allegro Microsystems. It drives six onboard N-channel power MOSFETs and supplies the motor with 8V up to 30V voltages. This pre-driver offers enable, direction, and brake inputs that can control motor functions and logic outputs for measuring motor rotation.",
