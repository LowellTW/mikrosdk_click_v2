    "short_description": "DAC 9 Click is a compact add-on board that contains a fully-featured, highly accurate digital-to-analog converter. This board features the DAC80501, a 16-bit voltage-output digital-to-analog converter with precision internal reference from Texas Instruments. It supports both I2C and SPI serial interface and offers a linearity of < 1 LSB. It also includes a 2.5V internal reference, giving full-scale output voltage ranges of 1.25V, 2.5V, or 5V, incorporate a Power-On Reset function, consume a low current of 1mA, and include a Power-Down feature that reduces current consumption to typically 15Î¼A at 5V.",
