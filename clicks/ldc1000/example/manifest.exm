    "name": "LDC 1000 Click",
    "description": "LDC1000 click carries the world's first inductance-to-digital converter IC, along with a detachable sensor (an LC tank comprising a 36-turn PCB coil and a 100pF 1% NPO capacitor). The LDC1000 IC has a sub-micron resolution in short range applications; the board is ideal for highly precise short range measurements of the position, motion or composition of conductive targets.",
