    "short_description": "Relay 5 Click is a compact add-on board with general-purpose relays that any host MCU can control. This board features three J1031C3VDC.15S, a high-current single-pole double-throw (SPDT) signal relays controlled by the PCA9538A, a low-voltage 8-bit I/O port expander from NXP Semiconductors. Highly sensitive, the J1031C3VDC.15S offers a low coil power consumption in a small, lightweight package with PC pin mounting. It comes with a dimension of 12.5x7.5x10 millimeters (LxWxH) and a 1C contact arrangement with a coil voltage of 3VDC, providing a maximum switching voltage of 125VAC/60VDC.",
