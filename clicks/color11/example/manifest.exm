    "description": "Color 11 Click is a compact add-on board that provides an accurate color-sensing solution. This board features the TCS34083M, an ALS/color sensor with selective flicker detection from ams-OSRAM. The sensor features ambient light and color (RGB) sensing and flicker detection, which suppresses cross-coupling from 940nm IR if generated by adjacent circuits. The main benefits of this sensor are invisible ALS and color sensing under any glass type, unique fast ALS integration mode, and more. It features configurable programmable gain and integration time, tailored ALS and color response, ALS/color interrupt with thresholds, and many more.",
