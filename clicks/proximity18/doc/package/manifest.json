    "short_description": "Proximity 18 Click is a compact add-on board that contains a close-range proximity sensing solution. This board features the VCNL3036X01, a high-resolution digital proximity sensor from Vishay Semiconductors. Besides the proximity sensor, the VCNL3036X01 also integrates a mux and a driver for three external LEDs, which are located near the chip on the board, photodiodes, amplifiers, and analog to digital converting circuits into a single chip by CMOS process. It allows absolute distance measurement, whatever the target color and reflectance, providing an accurate range of up to 50cm.",
