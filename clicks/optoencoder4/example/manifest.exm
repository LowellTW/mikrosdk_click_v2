    "name": "Opto Encoder 4 Click",
    "description": "Opto Encoder 4 Click is a compact add-on board that contains an optical sensor/encoder that can be used for movement or rotation encoding. This board features the EE-SX4330, a transmissive photo-microsensor from OMRON. It is intended to be used with an encoder disk or similar device that will act as a barrier between the emitter and detector of the sensor. Usually, it will be the disk with perforations, which is commonly used to detect the rotation speed.",
