    "short_description": "VAV Press Click is a compact add-on board that contains a board-mount pressure sensor. This board features the LMIS025B, a low differential pressure sensor from First Sensor (part of TE Connectivity). It is based on thermal flow measurement of gas through a micro-flow channel integrated within the sensor chip. The innovative LMI technology features superior sensitivity, especially for ultra-low pressures ranging from 0 to 25Pa. The extremely low gas flow through the sensor ensures high immunity to dust contamination, humidity, and long tubing compared to other flow-based pressure sensors.",
