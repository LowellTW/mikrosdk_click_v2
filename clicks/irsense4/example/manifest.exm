    "description": "IR Sense 4 Click is a compact add-on board that can be used in short-range IR sensing applications. This board features the STHS34PF80, a low-power high-sensitivity infrared (IR) sensor from STMicroelectronics. It is a sensor for presence and motion detection and can reach up to 4m without a lens for object measuring. The sensor can detect stationary objects and distinguish them from moving objects.",
