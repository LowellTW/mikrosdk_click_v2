    "description": "EEPROM 6 Click is a compact add-on board that contains a serial EEPROM memory that operates from the 1-Wire interface. This board features the DS28EC20, a 20480-bit EEPROM organized as 80 memory pages of 256 bits each from Analog Devices. As a specific feature, blocks of eight memory pages can be write-protected or put in “EPROM-Emulation” Mode, where bits can only be changed from a 1 to a 0 state. It communicates with MCU at 15.4kbps or 90kbps over the 1-Wire protocol and has a 64-bit registration number that ensures error-free device selection.",
