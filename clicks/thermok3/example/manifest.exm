    "description": "Thermo K 3 Click is a compact add-on board that provides accurate temperature measurements with a thermocouple probe. This board features the MAX6675, a cold-junction-compensated K-thermocouple-to-digital converter from Analog Devices. With the versatile type-K probe, this board enables precise temperature measurements of up to +700°C in 12-bit (0.25°C) resolution. This board can measure temperatures as high as +1024°C but with less precision. It features cold-junction compensation sensing and correction and open thermocouple detection.",
