    "short_description": "I2C MUX 7 Click is a compact add-on board representing a bidirectional selector dedicated to applications with I2C slave address conflicts. This board features the PI4MSD5V9547, an octal bidirectional translating multiplexer controlled by the I2C-bus from Texas Instruments. Only one SCL/SDA channel can be selected at a time, determined by the contents of the programmable control register. The board powers up with Channel 0 connected, allowing immediate communication between the Master and downstream devices on that channel.",
