    "short_description": "Temp&Hum 23 Click is a compact add-on board representing temperature and humidity sensing solution. This board features the SHT45, a 4th generation ultra-low-power relative humidity and temperature sensor from Sensirion. The SHT45 is characterized by its high accuracy (±1% RH and ±0.1°C over a wide operating temperature range) and high resolution providing 16-bit data to the host controller with a configurable I2C interface. Also, it is designed for reliable operation in harsh conditions such as condensing environments. This Click board™ is perfectly suitable for high-volume applications.",
