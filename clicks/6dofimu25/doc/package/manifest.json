    "short_description": "6DOF IMU 25 Click is a compact add-on board for biopotential signal detection and motion tracking applications. This board features the ST1VAFE6AX biosensor from STMicroelectronics, which combines a vertical analog front-end (vAFE) for biopotential sensing with a high-performance 6-axis IMU. The IMU features a 3-axis accelerometer and 3-axis gyroscope with adjustable full-scale ranges, along with advanced functionalities like finite state machine (FSM), adaptive self-configuration (ASC), and a machine learning core (MLC) for on-device processing. The board also includes a 4.5KB FIFO buffer for efficient data handling and supports I2C and SPI communication interfaces for easy integration.",
