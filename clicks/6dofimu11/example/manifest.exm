    "description": "The 6DOF IMU 11 click is a Click boardâ„¢ based on the KMX63, a 6 Degrees-of-Freedom inertial sensor system on a single, silicon chip, which is designed to strike a balance between current consumption and noise performance with excellent bias stability over temperature. The KMX63 sensor consists of a tri-axial magnetometer plus a triaxial accelerometer coupled with an ASIC.",
