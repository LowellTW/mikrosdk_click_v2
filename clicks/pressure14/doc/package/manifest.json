    "short_description": "Pressure 14 Click is a compact add-on board that contains a board-mount pressure sensor. This board features the ABP2LANT060PG2A3XX, a piezoresistive silicon pressure sensor offering a digital output for reading pressure over the specified full-scale pressure span and a temperature range from Honeywell Sensing and Productivity Solutions. This I2C configurable sensor is calibrated and temperature compensated for sensor offset, sensitivity, temperature effects, and accuracy errors, including non-linearity, repeatability, and hysteresis, using an on-board ASIC. This Click boardâ„¢ is suitable for pressure measurements in automotive applications, industrial and consumer applications.",
