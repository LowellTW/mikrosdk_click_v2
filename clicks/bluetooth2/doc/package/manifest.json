    "short_description": "Bluetooth 2 Click features WT41u, a long range class 1, Bluetooth® 2.1 + EDR module. WT41u is a highly integrated and sophisticated Bluetooth® module, containing all the necessary elements from Bluetooth® radio and a fully implemented protocol stack. Therefore WT41u provides an ideal solution for developers who want to integrate Bluetooth® wireless technology into their design with limited knowledge of Bluetooth® and RF technologies. WT41u optimized for long range applications is available with an integrated chip antenna. By default, the WT41u module is equipped with powerful and easy-to-use iWRAP firmware which enables users to access Bluetooth® functionality with simple ASCII commands delivered to the module over serial interface - it's just like a Bluetooth® modem.",
