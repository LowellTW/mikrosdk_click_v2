    "short_description": "Ambient 18 Click is a compact add-on board used to sense the amount of the present ambient light. This board features the BH1680FVC, an analog current-output ambient light sensor from Rohm Semiconductor. The BH1680FVC can detect a wide range of illuminance up to 10klx and provides excellent responsivity close to the human eyes' response. Besides, it is also characterized by low sensitivity variation across various light sources, a built-in shutdown function, and the ability to process the output signal in analog or digital form. This Click boardâ„¢ is the most suitable for obtaining ambient light data for adjusting brightness in applications that require power saving and better visibility.",
